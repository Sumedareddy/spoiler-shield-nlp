"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right? LOST spoilers","I love Lost. It is my favorite show ever and I always have to come defend it when people say they were dead the whole time or they didn't like the ending. I watched the show when it was airing. I couldn't wait to watch each episode and then go to different web sites and read people thoughts, look for Easter eggs and discuss each episode.

I did like the ending. When people say they left questions unanswered I really think it is more they didn't like the answers more then they didn't get answers. The answers came down to it was a magic island and I understand that not being satisfactory to some. But I just enjoyed the ride and didn't expect a huge payoff at the ends.

Below is a writeup I did to a thread in the past when someone was saying they ""got no answers and the ending made no sense""

This is basically my attempt to explain the ending of Lost.

>!\>!Ending of lost – First they were not dead the whole time.!<

>!Part of the story in season 6 of lost is the flash sideways. The flash sideways are “purgatory” or a meeting place after they all die before they go onto the afterlife. The losties go to the flash sideways after they die and meet with the most important people in their life before moving on. It does not mean they died at the same time or in the same way. For example Jack goes to “flash sideway land” after he dies on the island. Hurley goes many years later after protecting the island for many years. Locke goes after he is hung by Ben – Remember there is “no now here” in flash sideway land so time doesn’t matter, they all arrive after they die. (I saw you asked why. The answer is this is how the afterlife works in lost world. After you die you meet with the people who had the biggest impact on your life and you “move on” together).!<

>!The flash sideways land is the only place they are dead. The island is real; the things that happened on the island are real.!<

>!Background-!<

>!\-The island is the “center” of a magic light\*  that needs to be protected (More on the light later)!<

>!\-For the story we see the light is protected by two people – Jacob and MIB (man in black)!<

>!\-Jacob takes the job of protecting the light seriously.!<

>!\-Jacob also leads people to the island because he is curious about human behavior he is also looking for his eventual replacement to protect the light.!<

>!\-Jocob and MIB are really brothers. The previous protector of the light took them in and raised them as their mother.!<

>!\-MIB killed his mother, previous protector of the light. Jacob was mad and threw him into the light and he became a smoke monster. He can now take the form of dead people.!<

>!\-MIB hates living on the island and is looking for a way off.!<

>!\-MIB needs to kill Jacob to leave the island, but the mother made it impossible for Jacob/MIB to hurt each other.!<

>!\-If this happens no one would be there to protect the light and this is dangerous for the world.!<

>!Okay, so that is your magic island and the background for everything that happens. Like I said, I understand if you don’t like the magic island. And I agree without that it does not make sense without the magic.!<

>!(Dharma, Black Rock, Flight 815 and everyone else we saw on the island was manipulated to come there by Jacob to either study them, have them help protect the light or check if they could be his replacement.)!<

>!The ending of the show was basically how the MIB/Jacob situation played out. MIB showed up as Locke, who was dead, and tricked Ben into killing Jacob. Jacob passed protection on to Jack who was then made changes to the light to make MIB mortal and kill him. Jack dies, but first passes the protecting of the light on to Hurley.!<

>!That is my readers digest summation of the show and the ending. It has been several years since I watched the show so I may have missed details.!<

>!Okay about the Light - what it is and why does it need protection.!<

>!I believe this is a detail they intentionally didn’t answer, because they wanted people to figure it out. But I believe the light is the source of “time”. At one point someone describes the light as “something everyone has, but everyone wants more of.”  The fact the light is the force that results in time passing explains the time travel, moving island, exotic matter, strange electromagnetic properties of the island. – but like I said this is my theory on the light. It was never explicitly answered.!<!<",Spoiler,love lost favorite show ever always come defend people say dead whole time didnt like ending watched show airing couldnt wait watch episode go different web sites read people thoughts look easter eggs discuss episodei like ending people say left questions unanswered really think didnt like answers didnt get answers answers came magic island understand satisfactory enjoyed ride didnt expect huge payoff endsbelow writeup thread past someone saying got answers ending made sensethis basically attempt explain ending lostending lost first dead whole timepart story season lost flash sideways flash sideways purgatory meeting place die go onto afterlife losties go flash sideways die meet important people life moving mean died time way example jack goes flash sideway land dies island hurley goes many years later protecting island many years locke goes hung ben remember flash sideway land time doesnt matter arrive die saw asked answer afterlife works lost world die meet people biggest impact life move togetherthe flash sideways land place dead island real things happened island realbackgroundthe island center magic light needs protected light laterfor story see light protected two people jacob mib man blackjacob takes job protecting light seriouslyjacob also leads people island curious human behavior also looking eventual replacement protect lightjocob mib really brothers previous protector light took raised mothermib killed mother previous protector light jacob mad threw light became smoke monster take form dead peoplemib hates living island looking way offmib needs kill jacob leave island mother made impossible jacobmib hurt otherif happens one would protect light dangerous worldokay magic island background everything happens like said understand dont like magic island agree without make sense without magicdharma black rock flight everyone else saw island manipulated come jacob either study help protect light check could replacementthe ending show basically mibjacob situation played mib showed locke dead tricked ben killing jacob jacob passed protection jack made changes light make mib mortal kill jack dies first passes protecting light hurleythat readers digest summation show ending several years since watched show may missed detailsokay light need protectioni believe detail intentionally didnt answer wanted people figure believe light source time one point someone describes light something everyone everyone wants fact light force results time passing explains time travel moving island exotic matter strange electromagnetic properties island like said theory light never explicitly answered
"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right? LOST spoilers","My beef with LOST was how the show runners kept making claims around “this is how it is/will be/wont be” and they threw out their own rules. 

It could also be that clever watchers hypothesized things correctly and they didn’t want to give it away (like >!time travel!< ). Maybe showrunners learned it’s better to just say “wait and see” instead of “no, we are not doing that.” [And then doing exactly that](https://www.tv-calling.com/quotes-from-lost-showrunners-carlton-cuse-and-damon-lindelof/). 

I feel like LOST was a big “phenomenon” of its time (maybe parallels to GOT in that regards?), but it definitely had strong fans and strong detractors. 

I think I’ll have to put it back on and watch again, because the mystery of the early seasons was so good.

(Also, I posted once and automod flagged it because I didn’t do spoiler tags correctly, I dig that attention to comment detail!)",Spoiler,beef lost show runners kept making claims around iswill bewont threw rules could also clever watchers hypothesized things correctly didnt want give away like time travel maybe showrunners learned better say wait see instead exactly feel like lost big phenomenon time maybe parallels got regards definitely strong fans strong detractors think ill put back watch mystery early seasons goodalso posted automod flagged didnt spoiler tags correctly dig attention comment detail

I don't understand why they didn't do the latter. It would have made a lot of sense if she'd been given basic weapons training as well as having her tech skills put to use formally.

>Can't someone who works at an embassy legally get her family to the U.S.? If it was that hard, how did she make it to NYC? 

It's because it's Iran. It's the authoritarian Iranian regime that's curbing freedoms and stopping its citizens emigrating to the US. Noor made it to NYC because she's working for the regime. She's still, in a sense, on their turf, and she's obviously not free, even there.

"What shows have ""Caught the Shark"" as opposed to ""Jumped the Shark""? i.e. They made a choice that looks Big and Bad and Misplaced and it ended up working (inspired by Fargo FX series. Major spoiler safely redacted in body of post)","I feel like ""caught the shark"" is the wrong phrase. To my mind it feels like that should be the term for when a show (a) was regarded as having jumped the shark and then (b) later did something that caused people to go ""Oh, I get it now"" and what had been regarded as jumping the shark is re-evaluated, What you're talking about seems more like ""owned the shark"".

For example, if Doctor Who had revealed that the timeless child was actually the Master's origin story, then I really think that people would have a totally different opinion about the timeless child as a concept. So, this I would describe as catching the shark.

As to actual example of *this* version of catching the shark? I guess The Wire sort of makes sense. I'm not sure at which point after S2 finishes that S2 makes sense, but it does eventually happen.

In terms of ""owning the shark"", i.e. what you're calling catching the shark, I think I agree with Fring's >!death!< in Breaking Bad. It should feel ridiculous but it never does. Another example would be Agents of SHIELD which literally blew up its whole concept about 2/3 of the way through its first series. Everyone agrees this was a good idea (but the stuff before that moment is seriously over-hated).

I'm a bit torn about Supernatural which someone else also mentioned. I think for most people introducing angels was owning the shark, but for me Supernatural before the angels show up is pretty crap. In other words Castiel's arrival is more like growing the beard than owning the shark. Though that's a bit unfair to S3.

&#x200B;

I really wanted to like this but man...it was rough. I'll start with the ending. Hands down one of the worst executed ""twists"" I've ever seen. A good twist should leave you smacking your head and saying ""Oh damn. Of course. How could a miss that!"" Think >!Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense!< or >!Tyler Durden in Fight Club!< or >!Norman Bates in Psycho.!< There is zero plot reasoning set up in the preceding 7+ hours that set up Jayden as the killer and there was zero narrative reasoning for why her being the killer makes the story better. At the end of The Usual Suspects, I'm sitting there staring at the screen thinking ***mind blown*** while at the end of this show I'm sitting there staring at the screen thinking, OK. Whatevs ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

If they had gone with Rusty covering up the murder that his wife committed, that is interesting and compelling and once it is revealed you look back at things like his reaction to her and the bartender and his losing control on the stand and it all makes sense. The ending they went with is just really bad storytelling. It doesn't connect to rest of the story. And the rest of the story was SEVEN HOURS LONG! It's not like they had to squeeze out something in a 115 minute movie. They could have taken any number of the countless pointless minutes long shots of a character staring at something and used that to lay a little groundwork for what was to come and character development for Jayden. This was like watching The Sixth Sense and at the end it is revealed that >!Bruce Willis' wife is a ghost.!< You'd be sitting there like, OK. What was the point of all of that? 

And about those excruciatingly long shots that lead to and signified nothing and added just as much to the story. This could easily have been a 4 episode show. Or hell, if you want to re-make it with a modern take as another movie, just do that. But this was waayyyyy to long of a show. 

My final thoughts on things that I had a problem with. The lawyer having an electrical problem with his heart was the cheapest, most sophomoric attempt at building suspense and tension that I've seen in a long time. Rusty representing himself after that event was one of the dumbest, most unrealistic things I've seen right up until they decided to have him give his own closing statement, which immediately became the dumbest, most unrealistic thing I've seen in a long time. 

Now, it did have things I liked. Carolyn. You're going to go with eight 50+ minute episodes, start it earlier in the timeline. Let me see Carolyn cook. Let me see some crazy. Let me see her being a bad ass bitch. She's the most interesting character in the story but she's dead before we begin. Tommy Malto. Gimme more Tommy Malto! Give me a second season revolving around Tommy's next case and how he's trying to win back the love and respect of his cat after disappointing his furry feline friend by losing the Rusty Sabitch case so spectacularly. The cat's obvious utter contentment it felt for Tommy was probably the 3rd best thing about the entire series. The Mya character. She was like having the biggest, coolest, most explosive firework on the Fourth of July and not shooting it off. If she had jumped in the lead position for the defense after Raymond had his case of indigestion, I feel like that would have fixed like 75% of the problems the show had. 

But the ending? There was no fixing that mess. All that said, I'll be back for season 2.",Spoiler,spoilers replyxbi really wanted like manit rough ill start ending hands one worst executed twists ive ever seen good twist leave smacking head saying oh damn course could miss think bruce willis sixth sense tyler durden fight club norman bates psycho zero plot reasoning set preceding hours set jayden killer zero narrative reasoning killer makes story better end usual suspects im sitting staring screen thinking mind blown end show im sitting staring screen thinking ok whatevs gone rusty covering murder wife committed interesting compelling revealed look back things like reaction bartender losing control stand makes sense ending went really bad storytelling doesnt connect rest story rest story seven hours long like squeeze something minute movie could taken number countless pointless minutes long shots character staring something used lay little groundwork come character development jayden like watching sixth sense end revealed bruce willis wife ghost youd sitting like ok point excruciatingly long shots lead signified nothing added much story could easily episode show hell want remake modern take another movie waayyyyy long show final thoughts things problem lawyer electrical problem heart cheapest sophomoric attempt building suspense tension ive seen long time rusty representing event one dumbest unrealistic things ive seen right decided give closing statement immediately became dumbest unrealistic thing ive seen long time things liked carolyn youre going go eight minute episodes start earlier timeline let see carolyn cook let see crazy let see bad ass bitch shes interesting character story shes dead begin tommy malto gimme tommy malto give second season revolving around tommys next case hes trying win back love respect cat disappointing furry feline friend losing rusty sabitch case spectacularly cats obvious utter contentment felt tommy probably rd best thing entire series mya character like biggest coolest explosive firework fourth july shooting jumped lead position defense raymond case indigestion feel like would fixed like problems show ending fixing mess said ill back season
'Presumed Innocent' finale discussion [spoilers],"Hmm, torn. On the one hand, I'm not sure if I like the outcome. What daughter would realistically kill somebody for fear of breaking up Mom and Dad? At least the reveal from the OG was plausible - >!what wife ***hasn't*** dreamt about fucking up a hubby's mistress!<? Also, why does Rusty not rat her out to the cops? He's a family man, sure, but what happens if the kid kills again? Or blabs about it to the therapist? *Both of which a distraught teen could do?*

On the other hand, who cares? Show was brilliantly acted all around. As far as Bad Robot ending shenanigans go, this was hardly the worst stunt they've pulled. (Hi, *Star Wars IX!*) And when the rest of it was this compelling, I find it very hard to condemn it for the last five minutes. Overall, it was a hell of a fun ride.

'Presumed Innocent' finale discussion [spoilers],"Great acting all around from a strong cast, peter sarsgaard was the standout among the rest. I definitely didn't see the final twist coming: >!the daughter killing that cheating DA!<. I thought the killer was gyllenhaal's son and he was taking the fall. The murder mystery aspect was laid out really well.

It wasn't really realistic for a DA to have been investigating the crime; that's a minor point that take away from my suspension of disbelief but other than that the overall story was still plausible. I also didn't like how the killer got away with no consequences at the end.

**Overall** ***Presumed Innocent*** **(2024) rating: 8/10, finally a strong series from Apple TV after a bunch of duds (*****The Last Thing He Told Me, Black Bird, Criminal Record*****)**",Spoiler,great acting around strong cast peter sarsgaard standout among rest definitely didnt see final twist coming daughter killing cheating da thought killer gyllenhaals son taking fall murder mystery aspect laid really wellit wasnt really realistic da investigating crime thats minor point take away suspension disbelief overall story still plausible also didnt like killer got away consequences endoverall presumed innocent rating finally strong series apple tv bunch duds last thing told black bird criminal record

Apple’s ‘No Villain Clause’ for iPhones On-Screen: All About the Alleged Rule,"That's not entirely clear to me.

Looking it up, I see [this 2012 Business Insider article](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-product-placements-in-tv-and-movies-2012-8) that says while Apple hasn't paid for product placement since the 90's, they would happily supply free devices to movies and shows. It does not mention any conditions Apple would supply and allow or forbid their logo to be shown.

That article references [this Washington Post article from 2008](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401670.html) which notes in the show 24, the good guys use Apple and the bad guys use Windows, but again no reference to any explicit rule.



As far as I can find through my brief google search, Rian Johnson is the originating source of this story, and obviously he had motive to make this into a red herring. I have no idea if he made it up out of whole cloth or if this was this a rule only known to prop departments that he was actually told and he wanted to be clever with it.

If that is indeed a rule that Rian Johnson had to follow in Glass Onion, >!he did technically stay within it's bounds even if he did so while dancing through loopholes.!<",Spoiler,thats entirely clear melooking see business insider article says apple hasnt paid product placement since would happily supply free devices movies shows mention conditions apple would supply allow forbid logo shownthat article references washington post article notes show good guys use apple bad guys use windows reference explicit ruleas far find brief google search rian johnson originating source story obviously motive make red herring idea made whole cloth rule known prop departments actually told wanted clever itif indeed rule rian johnson follow glass onion technically stay within bounds even dancing loopholes

Arcane S2 (wtf) (no spoilers),"Season 2 feels very different in comparsion to Season 1.

Season 1 had the peak of the unique artstyle, artistic approach, and an emotional story with a limited set of characters. Season 2 bloats the artistic approach by adding music video scenes to grab us emotionally. The songs were good, but they overdid it. Instead of 5 minute music shows, they could have add meaningful lines to drive the story forward, and the story suffers in S2.

Season 1 ""just"" had two Maincharacters, and a small cast as a sideplot to show us why the city is divided. Now in S2 every side character wants a piece of that cake, but everyone wants a bigger piece than the others. Sadly, some characters development suffer from the pacing, sometimes complete missing for some episodes.

"'Shrinking' is a perfect TV show, can't change my mind","I think I'm on the same wavelength here, where I still like it and find it funny if not a little cringe, but mostly I find myself getting pulled out of it when I disagree or agree but question some of its moral takes, because it does feel very smug about them--like if you use enough psychobabble it *must* be the correct thing, and you'd be wrong to think otherwise, it's just science. I remind myself it's still a bit of a fantastical show in the same vein as Scrubs or Ted Lasso, but it does still annoy me at times. Spoilers ahead!

>!For example, I'm a man and some of my best friends are married women who I have not nearly enough sexual interest in to even consider trying to get them to cheat, not to mention the fact that I wouldn't do anything when I do. It seemed to imply in the episode where Liz kisses Mac for a few ~~Mississippi~~ Cincinnati that men only befriend women for sex. The characters we look to for expertise in the show, Harrison Ford especially, pretty much says that men don't have women friends that they're not trying to fuck. However, obviously Jimmy and Liz are friends, Brian and Jimmy are friends, and so on and so forth, so it seems like what they were really trying to say is that men don't do the things that Mac does, specifically, unless they're trying to cheat. But that is not how it came across to me. It sounded like the old tired ""all men are secretly homewreckers"" thing mixed with ""all women secretly want to have their homes wrecked"" thing.!<

>!Another example is how they all convinced Brian that he should adopt a kid by basically telling him ""all of your fears and unfounded and you are wrong about yourself and you will enjoy having a kid."" I think they basically gaslit him into this viewpoint, and I happen to want kids myself for basically all of the same reasons they gave, but if I had doubts, I'd want them properly explored and explained because having children is life-shatteringly monumental a decision, not something you can just be like ""oh I guess you're right"" about. Relationships rightfully end because there is no compromising on this issue, you can't have half a kid or condemn your partner to being a single parent while at the same time you pretend you're still in a relationship. They explore this a little in the episode following, but it still seems like remaining childfree is being presented not as a legitimate choice but as a pathology born of fear and immaturity.!<

>!Finally, and this is ironically the easiest for me to forgive, is how easy forgiveness is portrayed, whether that's Summer and Alice, or Roy Kent and Alice, or even Jimmy's patient whom he goaded into attempted murder and himself. There isn't time or space on the show to really dig into the heavy pain that these things cause, as the show is focused on the positive and how to arrive at happy endings, not on exploring the depths of that pain. But I still have to stop and convince myself that the show is supposed to be happy when it has these very unhappy plot points that I'd naturally expect a lot more rage and sadness and negativity around. Sometimes that negativity is played for laughs, e.g. Summer making a TikTok video with a catchy auto tune, and it was a pretty funny bit, but it is so cartoonishly fantasy-land happy-go-lucky to me that it almost felt like it was ignoring this whole other dimension of human emotion in order to just be like ""it'll be okay!"" Yes, it will, but it is hard work to get there for most people. It almost feels flippant to the people who are fighting through their conflicts with other people to just have them say ""I love you"" after pouting in each other's general direction for a bit.!<

All of that to say I'm gonna keep watching it though lol.",Spoiler,think im wavelength still like find funny little cringe mostly find getting pulled disagree agree question moral takes feel smug themlike use enough psychobabble must correct thing youd wrong think otherwise science remind still bit fantastical show vein scrubs ted lasso still annoy times spoilers aheadfor example im man best friends married women nearly enough sexual interest even consider trying get cheat mention fact wouldnt anything seemed imply episode liz kisses mac mississippi cincinnati men befriend women sex characters look expertise show harrison ford especially pretty much says men dont women friends theyre trying fuck however obviously jimmy liz friends brian jimmy friends forth seems like really trying say men dont things mac specifically unless theyre trying cheat came across sounded like old tired men secretly homewreckers thing mixed women secretly want homes wrecked thinganother example convinced brian adopt kid basically telling fears unfounded wrong enjoy kid think basically gaslit viewpoint happen want kids basically reasons gave doubts id want properly explored explained children lifeshatteringly monumental decision something like oh guess youre right relationships rightfully end compromising issue cant half kid condemn partner single parent time pretend youre still relationship explore little episode following still seems like remaining childfree presented legitimate choice pathology born fear immaturityfinally ironically easiest forgive easy forgiveness portrayed whether thats summer alice roy kent alice even jimmys patient goaded attempted murder isnt time space show really dig heavy pain things cause show focused positive arrive happy endings exploring depths pain still stop convince show supposed happy unhappy plot points id naturally expect lot rage sadness negativity around sometimes negativity played laughs eg summer making tiktok video catchy auto tune pretty funny bit cartoonishly fantasyland happygolucky almost felt like ignoring whole dimension human emotion order like itll okay yes hard work get people almost feels flippant people fighting conflicts people say love pouting others general direction bitall say im gonna keep watching though lol

Reacher review: Binge-worthy take on your favorite airport novel hero,"I've tried reading the Reacher novels by Lee Child and I gave up. One of the things I just can't let go and maybe this is just my hang up is how many unbelievable coincidences he relies on to move the story forward. 

I had a creative writing teacher in high school who said something that has stuck with me since then. He said it was sometimes okay to use coincidence to create problems for the protagonist to overcome but never okay to use it to solve those problems. Coincidence should only be used sparingly no matter what and the plot shouldn't rely on it. He said it was a tool used by lazy writers to solve situations where they have painted themselves into a corner or don't know how to move the story forward by other means. I whole heartedly agree with this and even then the coincidence should be believable. When I see it on screen it stands out like a flaming dumpster to me.

>!The entire story hinges on the fact that Jack Reacher has a brother whom he hasn't spoken to for years and didn't know where he lived or worked. But somehow by completely unbelievable coincidence we're supposed to accept that Reacher just happened to randomly get off the bus in the same small Georgia town where his brother was murdered only hours earlier a few yards away? And he is almost immediately arrested for said murder? This was something that stood out for me in the book and they didn't fix it in the Amazon Prime show either.!< 

>!How hard would it have been to just say that the brothers stayed in touch even though it had been years since they had seen each other? It would have made perfect sense that Reacher ended up in town because he was supposed to meet his brother there. Perhaps his brother could have even asked Reacher for help with his investigation? It would have made a lot more sense than how it actually unfolded. It also would have made sense why he was arrested for the murder because of his connection to the victim. Pretty much everything else would have progressed mostly unchanged from that point on.!<

I have this same complaint about Dexter. How many times was Dexter almost caught but some convoluted string of events would occur and he would skate by mostly in the clear? Conversely I always admire Breaking Bad because they did the opposite. Walter White would often end up in bad situations due to his own choices that seemed impossible to overcome. But he somehow always managed to get the upper hand because he would use his intellect and think his way out of problems. Coincidence was something that rarely occurred on Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul. That level of writing is what makes those programs superior television. Reacher...not so much. Although it is fine pandemic binge material.",Spoiler,ive tried reading reacher novels lee child gave one things cant let go maybe hang many unbelievable coincidences relies move story forward creative writing teacher high school said something stuck since said sometimes okay use coincidence create problems protagonist overcome never okay use solve problems coincidence used sparingly matter plot shouldnt rely said tool used lazy writers solve situations painted corner dont know move story forward means whole heartedly agree even coincidence believable see screen stands like flaming dumpster methe entire story hinges fact jack reacher brother hasnt spoken years didnt know lived worked somehow completely unbelievable coincidence supposed accept reacher happened randomly get bus small georgia town brother murdered hours earlier yards away almost immediately arrested said murder something stood book didnt fix amazon prime show either hard would say brothers stayed touch even though years since seen would made perfect sense reacher ended town supposed meet brother perhaps brother could even asked reacher help investigation would made lot sense actually unfolded also would made sense arrested murder connection victim pretty much everything else would progressed mostly unchanged point oni complaint dexter many times dexter almost caught convoluted string events would occur would skate mostly clear conversely always admire breaking bad opposite walter white would often end bad situations due choices seemed impossible overcome somehow always managed get upper hand would use intellect think way problems coincidence something rarely occurred breaking bad better call saul level writing makes programs superior television reachernot much although fine pandemic binge material
Reacher review: Binge-worthy take on your favorite airport novel hero,"I mean, I love the books, but Reacher's leaps of logic at times are absolutely silly. It apes at what Doyle did with Sherlock, but I think ""Reacher being the smartest guy in the room"" is the weakest part of the formula. Because since no one can figure out what he needs to figure out in reality, it means the author has to write nearly everyone else as pretty damn stupid sometimes.

I think it was in Night School when >!they are trying to figure out what a particular piece of Army hardware that was stolen actually is. They know the name ""Davey Crockett"" is involved somehow. But it takes them chapters of sleuthing to figure out, oh it's the nuclear bombs we made called Davey Crocketts. Even I had heard about them, and I'm supposed to believe the smartest, bestest Army hero doesn't immediately think of them when he hears the name in connection with a terrorist plot?!<

I'm mostly nitpicking, because again, I do enjoy the books.",Spoiler,mean love books reachers leaps logic times absolutely silly apes doyle sherlock think reacher smartest guy room weakest part formula since one figure needs figure reality means author write nearly everyone else pretty damn stupid sometimesi think night school trying figure particular piece army hardware stolen actually know name davey crockett involved somehow takes chapters sleuthing figure oh nuclear bombs made called davey crocketts even heard im supposed believe smartest bestest army hero doesnt immediately think hears name connection terrorist plotim mostly nitpicking enjoy books

The Last of Us Season 2 | Review Megathread,"I'm with you. I really resonated with this part of the Kotaku review as I felt this critique applied equally to Season 1:

""Overall, the show seems scared of silence. Unlike a player experiencing the game, the viewer isn’t meant to inhabit a specific viewpoint and act out the scene. As a result, it seems the show’s creators have decided that it has to lay everything bare, leaving no action, motive, or regret to the imagination, just in case you weren’t sure that everyone here is complicit in the grief-driven cycle of violence that’s being perpetuated. *The Last of Us* season two doesn’t just want you to feel empathy for both its heroines; it wants to make sure you understand that this is the point. You might feel no sympathy for Abby, you may think Ellie has gone too far, but that’s not for you to decide. The show already knows the lesson it has to teach, and the collateral damage is that no one talks to each other like they aren’t aware that someone is watching them.""

For example, in TLOU season 1,>!when Joel and Ellie stop and talk in the FEMA camp in the finale, Joel's comment to Ellie that ""It wasn't time that did it"" was really unnecessary. Wasted opportunity to let the actors *act* and allow the audience to figure out why Joel was finally ready to tell Ellie that particular story. !<IMO, Better Call Saul is a great example of this with its ""show, don't tell"" writing. Plenty of unspoken moments in scenes that advance characters' storylines and motives perfectly without beating the viewer over the head with on-the-nose dialogue.",Spoiler,im really resonated part kotaku review felt critique applied equally season overall show seems scared silence unlike player experiencing game viewer isnt meant inhabit specific viewpoint act scene result seems shows creators decided lay everything bare leaving action motive regret imagination case werent sure everyone complicit griefdriven cycle violence thats perpetuated last us season two doesnt want feel empathy heroines wants make sure understand point might feel sympathy abby may think ellie gone far thats decide show already knows lesson teach collateral damage one talks like arent aware someone watching themfor example tlou season joel ellie stop talk fema camp finale joels comment ellie wasnt time really unnecessary wasted opportunity let actors act allow audience figure joel finally ready tell ellie particular story imo better call saul great example show dont tell writing plenty unspoken moments scenes advance characters storylines motives perfectly without beating viewer head onthenose dialogue

>!The movie starts with the FF living in this 60s retro futuristic universe where they are the main heroes and protectors. They are essentially celebrities who are adored by the public and appear in a TV show where they explain how they defeated Mole Man. Sue is pregnant with Franklin and the 4 of them work as space explorers for the government. But there's something off about the family, like a secret they are keeping, creating a tense atmosphere.!<

>!Then we get their origin story (the real one): the 4 of them were scientists/explorers back on Earth 616 when they accidentally caused a rift in space-time which took them to the retro-futuristic universe they are living in now and the radiation they experienced when the rift opened gave them their powers. When they arrived in this new universe, they used their powers to stop Mole Man from an attack in New York which made them celebrities. So with no way to go back to their home world, they just accepted their fate. But Reed has been trying to make a portal to take them back all this time and he is even more motivated now that this world is about to be devoured.!<

>!Reed succeeds and the F4 are now posed with a moral dilemma: stay here and try to save this world that adores them and sees them as heroes with a large probability to fail, or just abandon them and go back to their world. The Surfer comes back to warn the F4 that time is running out and she learns about the portal and the Multiverse.

(GOTG3 spoilers) The Quill-Gamora resolution was perfect,">	Peter finally accepting the losses he’s suffered and that this new Gamora is not the same one he fell in love with was both satisfying and absolutely crushing. 


>!Gamora: *I bet we were a lot of fun.*!<

>!Peter (choked up): *Oh man. You have no idea.*!<

It had me tearing up at multiple points in the movie. This is the magic of both Marvel and James Gunn. What Marvel did with the Infinity Saga was give us this interwoven universe of storylines and characters that gave us a really broad reason to connect the characters apart from their movies. It enabled us to more clearly make connections from a sentiment in one movie as it is expressed in another, even if it isn’t intended as an explicit link.

An example, for me, that I couldn’t stop thinking of after walking out of the theater following *GotG vol 3:*

>	Vision: “But…a thing isn’t beautiful because it lasts. It is a privilege to be among them.”

That’s from *Avengers: Age of Ultron* and it’s talking about the human race, but it can just as easily be applied to love. What Peter and Gamora had wasn’t beautiful because of the all-too-brief time in which they had to live it. It’s beautiful because of so. Many. Reasons.

With regards to James Gunn, and with no disrespect intended to the other filmmakers - just an incredible roster of talent - who have brought their abilities to the MCU, from the beginning the *Guardians* have been the only set of movies/characters capable of generating their own heart and soul simply by existing together. You could make a case for Tony, but it wasn’t until Infinity War that he reeeeally hit his stride, and it was the driving force of Thanos that caused it. 

Gunn is a unique talent who was given freedom to hone his abilities at Marvel, and it’s such a shame Disney fumbled things as badly as they did with his old tweets/firing. Because if anyone was a natural successor to Feige it was always him, and while some DC holdouts might bitch and moan about him not being Zack Snyder, all it will take is a couple of movies at most. Because he creates characters you can’t help but care about. And they’re not just comedic throwaways, which has always been the most absurd criticism. They’re funny, but that humor is always hiding something deeper - it’s always a defense mechanism. 

And one final note on Chris Pratt. He’s become a lightning rod for controversy for years, despite no real evidence to support Elliot Page’s initial takedown of him on Twitter. I know the Church he apparently does attend (Zoe Church in LA) was founded by a former Hillsong pastor, but Pratt has made his beliefs on matters of “love is love and people should be free to be with who they want” very clear. He’s also not tied into one denomination, having had his daughter baptized at a Catholic Church preferred by Katherine Schwarzenegger and her family, and fairly recently made comments on a podcast suggesting (IIRC) that he’s become much more spiritual and personal in his Christianity, because he’s not a fan of the way Christians at large and the institutions promoting it are failing some of Jesus’ most basic teachings. Like kindness.

Phew. All of that is a prelude to say, Chris Pratt can really fucking act, and it gets lost in the weeds of all this nonsense. A few more years and life experience have given him the gravitas needed to really sell those emotional moments, he’s got the comedy chops, but he’s just so relatable on screen. I find myself wishing he could take a career path similar to that of…Christ, now I dunno. Maybe a Chris Evans? I’d love to see him working with guys like Rian Johnson, or on some smaller flicks. The blockbusters will still be there. Not everything has to be *The Tomorrow War* or *The Terminal List.*

Wholesome video of Florence Welch watching Guardians 3 and reacting to spoiler,"Thanks so much for asking! I can only have so many characters in the playlist description, I would've put all of this there if I could.

Since the conceit for the playlist is listening to the Guardians' story as it unfolds, I omitted songs that were part of the released Awesome Mixes that didn't actually play during the canonical story (also the reason why ""Vol 1"" ends with ""O-o-oh Child"" rather than ""I Want You Back"", since every song after ""Child"" actually plays from the Vol 2 cassette. And same reason why I start the Zune section at ""Father and Son""). I didn't want to just leave those songs out entirely though, since they are part of the canonical Awesome Mixes (just not heard diegetically), so I just bumped them to the bottom. Those include songs that play over the credits, songs that were only used in trailers, and my one little grey area in the list is that I also include songs that Gunn has specified would have been in the movies under other circumstances. So in order (with Vol 3 spoilers hidden):

\- Guardians Inferno: This was a [gag](https://youtu.be/3MMMe1drnZY) included on the Vol 2 home release, and you actually can hear it play at the end of the credits. Since it's so meta, I figured it was a good one to indicate the change in nature of the songs. I stuck to movie order after that.

\- Spirit in the Sky: Only appeared in Vol 1 trailers

\- Flash Light: Only appeared in Vol 2 credits

\- Fox on the Run: Only appeared in Vol 2 trailers

\- Koinu no Carnival: >!Plays over the Counter-Earth family's radio, so not canonically part of the Zune's music!<

\- I Will Dare: The only song on AMV3 that I didn't hear in the movie at all (I took notes to make sure I had the Zune order right lol). I'll pester Gunn's Twitter to hopefully get an answer on whether this was used or not. It's not in either of the main trailers either.

\- Draw the Line, Train in Vain, Caught in a Dream, New York Groove: These are the four songs Gunn provided to the Russo bros, in addition to Rubberband Man, as options for Guardians accompaniments. Since theoretically, any of them appearing was just as likely as Rubberband Man, I included them here - but lower than all the ones that were official Awesome Mix material.

\- Russian Roulette: I actually just added this literally this morning, after you'd already replied. James tweeted that this is the first and only time he couldn't use a song that he wanted to because of rights issues. So had it not been wrapped up in legal shenanigans, there's a good chance it would have been part of Vol 3.

\- Cruel to Be Kind: It's the one song James has specified that he wanted to put in every single Awesome Mix and couldn't find a place.

There are plenty of songs that could kind of fall into some of these categories: James published ""Meredith Quill's Complete Awesome Mix"" over the pandemic and it's full of songs he'd considered or was considering for Guardians stories. But since I wanted to be more specific to the movies as we know them (and because that playlist already exists - it's also worth checking out!), I only went with songs that were close enough to James' vision that he's called them out in particular in interviews.

I did leave out the Holiday Special songs, but for what I feel is good reason. The obvious one is that the Christmas songs don't quite fit with the tone of the rest of the playlist. But also, the songs of the HS ""Awesome Mix"" are of a very different nature from the usual Awesome Mixes. All but 3 of the songs don't really play from the Zune at all: instead they're playing from sources on Earth, or just straight-up needle drops that aren't tied to any background music or Zune or anything. There are even original songs that are performed live, so those don't come attached to the Zune either. Since so much of the music isn't Zune-based, it makes me question whether the three songs that play when on board the Bowie or in Knowhere are actually Zune-based too. Maybe they are, and if so, it would still be a departure for the tone of the playlist (although they wouldn't be completely out of the question). But if they aren't playing from the Zune, then they wouldn't need to be on the playlist as I envisioned it anyway. Maybe that's another question I can ask Gunn: if those three songs are actually playing from the Zune or not.

[Very small spoiler for Thor 4] A really interesting point raised about Valkyrie's commercial endeavours. Thoughts?,"Yeah, it's honestly quite a mess likely becuase of conflicting ideas between the Movies' and Shows' Producers.

But it's not even a bad thing. It just shows that Marvel finally gave their Producers more of a free hand to do the best they can, without having to limit themselves based on each other.

>""Was Loki or Wanda or Strange or Spiderman the one who broke the universe?""

This is a question that is still beyond me, because Feigi literally said like 50 times ""Ever since the Multiverse was opened at the end of the Loki Series."" Which to me is quite obvious what opened it up. It also supports the fact that ""What If"" was scheduled from the start, to happen after ""Loki.""

>Phases 1-3 were, more or less, a single story, carefully constructed to make sure it all fit together. Phase 4 isn't that anymore: it's more concerned with letting the individual movies/shows shine. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Exactly.

Plus, I honestly love that they've started expanding all the topics and themes that were earlier locked only to the certain Movies and Characters.
Like the theme of Gods and Thor - expanded to ""Moon Knight"" and ""Black Panther."" 

(little Spoiler for ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" here):
>!And I honestly like that there is a logical explanation as to why the Egiptian Gods were not in Thor 4 - because the Omnipotent City is a Physical Realm, where the Gods we see have their Physical Forms.

[WANDAVISION SPOILERS] Wandavision ended as it should have; I'm glad a lot of theories were revealed to be wrong.,"SPOILERS AND COMPLAINTS

>!\>!Agree on all of this. The show was about wandas emotions and how she dealt with them. The ending was so...not that. She fights Agatha and then becomes the Scarlett Witch and now she’s fine with her emotions except she actually isn’t based on the end credits scene. Like the aspect of her never got resolved. Episode 8 showed everything that was bringing her down and you’d expect, like Agatha said in that episode, the only way forward is backwards sometimes. But Wanda didn’t learn or grow from her flashbacks at all it seems. The thing that actually causes her to put down the hex is seeing all the towns people begging her to help.!<

>!And tbh the fight itself was very meh. She hits Agatha with a car and chases her to shoot red energy at her to start. Seeing her give Agatha nightmare was cool but didn’t advance anything. Then when they’re back in reality she just shoots more energy at her until her tunes are set up. And then it’s over. I didn’t feel it was that creative. Even with the kids in danger there never felt like the threat was that serious!<

>!And the ending felt cliche. “You don’t know what you’ve started/done”. “You’ll need me” “If I need you I’ll find you”. I feel like I’ve seen that so many times before.!<

Hawkeye and Black Widow have both got that weird plot armour buff where they just survive loads of instant death scenarios.

I could understand some whining if there was a very obvious distinction made between two versions of a character for the purposes of actual character work and story. Batman was nerfed for Nolan’s The Dark Knight trilogy and it makes perfect sense because of that gritty universe. Context is everything.

Yes, you could say that dude would lose in a straight fight to Affleck’s Batman. That’s a very clear and obvious storytelling difference: Affleck’s Batman is not only built like a tank, but his character mindset is one that is meant to take on gods. Christian Bale’s Batman is a just an above average fighter. It’s weird because both of them are human yet still there’s a clear difference in terms of how they’re MEANT to be. They’re different characters in massively different contexts.

Cool. Only THEN can you whine about inconsistencies. But there’s no evidence that Spidey has ever been treated like that. There isn’t a version of Spidey I can think of that is meant to be any weaker or stronger than what we’ve seen so far. They’re all vaguely in the same area.

"If Kang isn't behind the TVA and it really is a Loki, I don't think it's any variant who won against the Avengers in 2012. [Minor Episode 5 Spoilers]","I made the mistake of delving into Kang wiki this morning.

The more I read, the more I'm convinced Kang is as good of a possibility as God King Loki is.

Granted, Wiki might not be entirely accurate but these points stuck out to me:

1. Kang is Immortus in one version
2. Immortus is offered residence in Limbo by the Time Keepers
3. The residence in Limbo is referred to as a fortress (>!what were Loki and Sylvie approaching!<?)
4. Limbo is possibly >!the place beyond Alioth!<
5. Ravonna and Kang's well known romance in the comics
6. There's several other ties that makes it reaaaaaalllly hard to not consider Kang being the headline bad guy

None of this is me attempting to hype, or act, like I figured anything out. I have limited comics knowledge. Simply going off of what I've seen in all 5 episodes so far, and what I read online about certain characters.

Spoiler: The ending of Loki makes sense because...,"Counterpoint:  Loki Season 2 does not make sense (Disclaimer:  It is a fantastic show though!)

1. >!The timelines dying doesn't actually make sense in the universe.  If the timelines would die without being shepherded, then all of the timelines would've already died since Kang and the Loom didn't exist until deep into each timeline's evolution.  For instance, Victor didn't exist until billions of years into the timeline, so there were already infinite timelines that were obviously thriving.!<
2. >!The TVA doesn't make sense.  Time is simply an ordered series of events relative to an entity experiencing it or observing it.  If the TVA exists outside of time, then it's an unordered series of events, and anyone can send their consciousness to any event point at the TVA, ala Loki's timeslipping.  So either the show is fundamentally broken, or everyone at the TVA thinks they're outside of time when they really aren't.!<
3. >!Loki's timeslipping doesn't make sense.  He only time slips within the context of the show.  He could've, and should've, just jumped back to when he was a small child, told Odin what was happening hundreds or thousands of years ago, and Odin could've mustered the combined forces of huge numbers of very advanced civilizations to solve the problem.  A human built the loom largely alone, it's a safe bet the combined forces of the universe could've done better.!<
4. >!Then there's the problem of Loki's freezing time for targeted entities.  All he had to do was freeze time for the Loom, then he had infinite time to solve the problem of infinite timelines!<
5. >!On top of that, if Loki is able to do it, then \*all\* Lokis are able to do it.  So he could use timeslipping and the temp pads to have infinite Lokis freeze time for the Loom and have infinite time to solve infinite timelines!<

"In Alien (1979), Ash is observing the chestburster embryo inside Kane on his monitor, which he turns off when Ripley appears. While they talk, she tries to look in his microscope but Ash tells her to stop. After she leaves, he drinks a white fluid. Full details and spoilers in comments...","**Full explanation, with spoilers for Alien (1979):**

*Some of these observations may be unique to the Director’s Cut:*

>!In the film, Ash is an android pretending to be the science officer of the USCSS Nostromo, but the company has placed him there to ensure a xenomorph is returned to them for weapons research—even at the expense of the human crew’s lives. There are several examples of him enabling the alien to escape (for example, by preventing the crew from attacking the chestburster just as it emerges) or hindering the crews efforts to find and destroy it.!<

>!While “collating” his results from the medical scan of Kane, who is still “facehugged,” the camera focuses on Ash at his workstation. He is studying an X-ray (or similar scan) that clearly shows the head and eyes of a developing embryo, which will develop into a chestburster (and later xenomorph) that kills the rest of the crew. This means that he is aware something is growing inside Kane and likely expects it to emerge at some point (bottom right image; red arrow).!<

>!A few moments later, Ripley surprises him while he works and he quickly turns off his monitor so she can’t see what he’s doing. During their discussion, he gives vague answers that are technically correct but not actionable or useful for stopping the alien.!<

>!While he talks, Ripley looks into his microscope but he quickly tells her to “please don’t do that,” so she stops—possibly preventing her from seeing his samples or gaining any useful info (top right image).!<

>!After she leaves, Ash drinks a cup of white liquid that looks like milk, but that is later revealed to be the same circulation fluid (“blood”) that runs through the system of androids in the Alien universe. When Ash is killed later in the movie, his damaged internal systems spray this fluid from his severed neck (top left image).!<

>!Once the facehugger detaches from Kane, Ash radios Dallas and Ripley to come to the medical bay, without telling them what to expect. Once inside, they begin to search for the detached facehugger, and ash presses the button to seal the doors while they are still inside. While the facehugger ends up already being dead, this suggests that Ash thought it might still be alive and wanted Dallas and Ripley to come to the medical bay unprepared, where they might happen upon the facehugger. Since Ash is not alive, this could have allowed him to see how the facehugger responds to human hosts, and possibly to impregnate more of them. Closing the door would prevent the facehugger from escaping, but also prevent Dallas and Ripley from easily escaping from a live facehugger as well (bottom left image).!<

EDIT: u/BreastUsername found [a captioned YouTube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOxmONFwsG4) of the aforementioned scene! It cuts before the milk-drinking, and the door closing is from a later scene.

Also, to clarify—these are just a few of the subtle hints/foreshadowings that I observed. The movie has a few others, plus more overt scenes where Ash's actual actions foreshadow his motives (like opening the airlock against Ripley's orders) that I obviously haven't mentioned here since they're actual plot elements!",Spoiler,full explanation spoilers alien observations may unique directors cutin film ash android pretending science officer uscss nostromo company placed ensure xenomorph returned weapons researcheven expense human crews lives several examples enabling alien escape example preventing crew attacking chestburster emerges hindering crews efforts find destroy itwhile collating results medical scan kane still facehugged camera focuses ash workstation studying xray similar scan clearly shows head eyes developing embryo develop chestburster later xenomorph kills rest crew means aware something growing inside kane likely expects emerge point bottom right image red arrowa moments later ripley surprises works quickly turns monitor cant see hes discussion gives vague answers technically correct actionable useful stopping alienwhile talks ripley looks microscope quickly tells please dont stopspossibly preventing seeing samples gaining useful info top right imageafter leaves ash drinks cup white liquid looks like milk later revealed circulation fluid blood runs system androids alien universe ash killed later movie damaged internal systems spray fluid severed neck top left imageonce facehugger detaches kane ash radios dallas ripley come medical bay without telling expect inside begin search detached facehugger ash presses button seal doors still inside facehugger ends already dead suggests ash thought might still alive wanted dallas ripley come medical bay unprepared might happen upon facehugger since ash alive could allowed see facehugger responds human hosts possibly impregnate closing door would prevent facehugger escaping also prevent dallas ripley easily escaping live facehugger well bottom left imageedit ubreastusername found captioned youtube clip aforementioned scene cuts milkdrinking door closing later scenealso clarifythese subtle hintsforeshadowings observed movie others plus overt scenes ashs actual actions foreshadow motives like opening airlock ripleys orders obviously havent mentioned since theyre actual plot elements

I did like that they gave Sonny something resembling Elvex's dream (from the short story ""Robot Dreams"") but of course Susan Calvin had a rather different reaction to that dream in the short story. 

In fact that's one of the ways you can tell it's a surface-level change. If Calvin had >!scrambled Sonny's brain!<, it'd be >!a much shorter (or very different) movie!<, so they had to >!remove the brutal but logical consequence!< that made the original short story so memorable because they didn't want to have to rewrite the whole movie.

I have no doubt the film drew inspiration from Asimov even in is original form (it's hard to write about robots in anything but the most brute fashion without having some Asimov in the mix) and it was not a bad flick. I quite like Alex Proyas as a director. if I squint my eyes enough I can maybe imagine it was inspired by a lost Asimov robot manuscript.",Spoiler,screenplay called hardwired sprinkled asimov changed character names added scenes tell surfacelevel changes like gave sonny something resembling elvexs dream short story robot dreams course susan calvin rather different reaction dream short story fact thats one ways tell surfacelevel change calvin scrambled sonnys brain itd much shorter different movie remove brutal logical consequence made original short story memorable didnt want rewrite whole moviei doubt film drew inspiration asimov even original form hard write robots anything brute fashion without asimov mix bad flick quite like alex proyas director squint eyes enough maybe imagine inspired lost asimov robot manuscript

I would disagree with this almost entirely. In fact, AC is notorious for the fact that many of her mysteries are effectively unsolvable. If you have read a lot of her books, it is certainly possible to guess the culprit, simply because you kind of get used to the flow of her stories and the ratio of foregrounding/backgrounding she uses for culprits/victims/red herring characters, but it is frequently completely impossible to actually ferret out the actual explanation of what happened or any conclusive justification for it decisively being one character over another. 


It's been a while since i read Death on the Nile, but I *think* the movie added in some of the ""clues"" >!e.g. the missing red paint!< to make it more ""solvable""--and Death on the Nile is probably one of the more predictable endings of any of her books that I've read. And Then There Were None, for example, is completely and utterly impossible to solve. You can conceivably *guess* it, but there's no possible way to actually explain what happened until it is revealed. The same goes for a lot of her books.

Then again, maybe I am getting better at seeing the language of film, but the last shot with the mug and the message it communicates, when Craig's character sits down with all the knives pointing to his head -- stuff like that was distracting, like something that ought to be subconscious made overtly conscious. Hitting the audience over the head with the moments.

Spoiler-ish review:

>!It does seem that this Jurassic World series is attempting to mirror the original Trilogy in it's themes. The first is both surrounds the idea of a park full of dinosaurs, only with Jurassic Park being it being in a beta test and Jurassic World it being open. The second surrounds the idea of the dinosaurs as living things. The team go back to the dinosaurs on a seemingly peaceful mission where some shady stuff is going down from another team who end up bringing dinosaurs from the dinosaurs which inevitably escape. With the film ending with Dinosaurs being released into the world it does make me wonder if as a result Jurassic World III will be a sort of 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' but with Dinosaurs. It'd be essentially a rescue/survival movie which was essentially what Jurassic Park III at the end of the day.!<",Spoiler,bad movie great one eitherspoilerish reviewit seem jurassic world series attempting mirror original trilogy themes first surrounds idea park full dinosaurs jurassic park beta test jurassic world open second surrounds idea dinosaurs living things team go back dinosaurs seemingly peaceful mission shady stuff going another team end bringing dinosaurs dinosaurs inevitably escape film ending dinosaurs released world make wonder result jurassic world iii sort dawn planet apes dinosaurs itd essentially rescuesurvival movie essentially jurassic park iii end day

The part 2 taking place in the developing story at the mansion and, through flashbacks, developing Lockwood and Hammond's relationship and the actual story of recreating dinosaurs and then later finding out that Lockwood also went on to use this information to >!clone humans!< would have really given weight to the final reveal that >!Maisie!< was a result of this research .

The Lighthouse (2019) references the Sacha Schneider painting Hypnosis (1904),"Spoilers ahead:

>!The ending of the lighthouse closely resembles the fate of Prometheus, the Greek titan who is condemned to an eternity of torment by Zeus, for the crime of stealing the fire of Olympus and granting it to humanity. The fire in this myth is an analogy for technology, or more broadly, for man's striving towards knowledge. For his crime of stealing the fire of the Gods, Prometheus is set upon a boulder on a mountainside, and condemned to have his liver eaten by an Eagle (an emblem of Zeus) only to have it regrown the next day to begin the cycle anew. 

Prometheus is mentioned by Wake just before the final scene, and is also closely connected to the lighthouse itself. As Winslow peers into the light of the lighthouse in the second to last scene, he is overwhelmed by what he sees.

The second important character for the end scene is Proteus, an aquatic deity whom Wake represents. In Greek myth, Proteus is a deity that holds knowledge, but refuses to relinquish it. In myth Proteus continually shapeshifts his form in order to protect his knowledge. Importantly, Proteus is portrayed in modern art and literature as an allegory of the unconscious (by Carl Jung), self exploration (by James Joyce in Ulysses), and more broadly, by the seeking of ""higher knowledge"", similar to Prometheus.

I think these two characters of Greek Myth can be interpreted in many different ways. However, one of the key themes in the film is the idea of repressed homosexuality, and the historical precedent of mariners engaging in homosexual activity.

Other allegories and references to these themes include the one eyed gull (an allegory for the penis), Winslow masturbating over the mermaid only for it to turn into Wake, and Winslow and Wake almost sharing a kiss whilst drunk, amongst others. Interestingly, although we do not know the relationship Winslow has with his logging partner, it seems likely that his relationship with the man he killed had a similar homosexual capacity to Winslow's relationship with Wake. This is revealed as the story unfolds and Wake meets a similar end to Winslow's previous logging partner, compounding the analogy.

With these scenes of Greek Myth and homosexuality in mind, I think we have a much better understanding of the end scene of the lighthouse. As Winslow peers into the light (guarded by Wake, an allegory for Proteus) he is permanently scarred by what he sees in it, and this completes Winslows journey into madness which has been building up over the course of the previous scenes and the film overall. What Winslow sees in the lighthouse can be seen as an allegory for his own unconscious and sexual exploration: as Winslow reveals to himself his true sexuality (and the crimes he has committed to cover it up), he is driven mad due to the full repressive extent of the complex he has built up. What I think is particularly beautiful about this last scene, is that the ""light"" which Winslow peers into is pure, and representative of his sexuality - what seems to drive him mad is the course of repression he is forced into taking by the culture and time that he exists in.

I think there are many interpretations with this films, and I do think that Roger Eggers made the film to be interpreted in many ways, though I would say one of the main themes of the Lighthouse is about homosexuality, and many of the main themes highlight this - the Greek Myths, the mariners setting, the masturbation, the lack of any female characters and references. This is my interpretation, and it is by no means extensive, and I'd love to hear if anyone else has some Greek Mythology that is revealed by the film too!!<",Spoiler,spoilers aheadthe ending lighthouse closely resembles fate prometheus greek titan condemned eternity torment zeus crime stealing fire olympus granting humanity fire myth analogy technology broadly mans striving towards knowledge crime stealing fire gods prometheus set upon boulder mountainside condemned liver eaten eagle emblem zeus regrown next day begin cycle anew prometheus mentioned wake final scene also closely connected lighthouse winslow peers light lighthouse second last scene overwhelmed seesthe second important character end scene proteus aquatic deity wake represents greek myth proteus deity holds knowledge refuses relinquish myth proteus continually shapeshifts form order protect knowledge importantly proteus portrayed modern art literature allegory unconscious carl jung self exploration james joyce ulysses broadly seeking higher knowledge similar prometheusi think two characters greek myth interpreted many different ways however one key themes film idea repressed homosexuality historical precedent mariners engaging homosexual activityother allegories references themes include one eyed gull allegory penis winslow masturbating mermaid turn wake winslow wake almost sharing kiss whilst drunk amongst others interestingly although know relationship winslow logging partner seems likely relationship man killed similar homosexual capacity winslows relationship wake revealed story unfolds wake meets similar end winslows previous logging partner compounding analogywith scenes greek myth homosexuality mind think much better understanding end scene lighthouse winslow peers light guarded wake allegory proteus permanently scarred sees completes winslows journey madness building course previous scenes film overall winslow sees lighthouse seen allegory unconscious sexual exploration winslow reveals true sexuality crimes committed cover driven mad due full repressive extent complex built think particularly beautiful last scene light winslow peers pure representative sexuality seems drive mad course repression forced taking culture time exists ini think many interpretations films think roger eggers made film interpreted many ways though would say one main themes lighthouse homosexuality many main themes highlight greek myths mariners setting masturbation lack female characters references interpretation means extensive id love hear anyone else greek mythology revealed film

The Lighthouse (2019) references the Sacha Schneider painting Hypnosis (1904),"So there seems to be two main inspirations for the story of The Lighthouse. Though there are other interpretations that are just as valid, but from what I've seen online most people agree about these.

It is based off a real life situation where 2 (or 3?) men that were manning an island lighthouse off the coast of Britain disappeared. When relief came to check on the men/relieve them of duty, no one was on the island. No bodies, nothing. Their boat(s) were still there and there was no sign of a disturbance. The only odd thing was that it seemed one of them was in the middle of a meal, like there was a half-eaten meal on the table that hadn't been cleaned up. A journal was found that had daily logs from one of the men, it seemed to get slightly nonsensical towards the end of the entries. Theories about what happened all seem to assume they went crazy and either fell into the sea or tried to swim away for some reason. If I remember correctly there were some brutal storms before they had disappeared. Another movie was made on the subject called The Vanishing (2018).

The other inspiration for the film seems to be the story of Prometheus. There are two shots in particular that are straight from the myth. There is the shot of >!Willem Dafoe standing over Pattinson with a beam of light shooting from his eyes!< and >!then there is the shot of Pattinson getting his guts eaten by seagulls at the end of the movie!<.",Spoiler,seems two main inspirations story lighthouse though interpretations valid ive seen online people agree theseit based real life situation men manning island lighthouse coast britain disappeared relief came check menrelieve duty one island bodies nothing boats still sign disturbance odd thing seemed one middle meal like halfeaten meal table hadnt cleaned journal found daily logs one men seemed get slightly nonsensical towards end entries theories happened seem assume went crazy either fell sea tried swim away reason remember correctly brutal storms disappeared another movie made subject called vanishing inspiration film seems story prometheus two shots particular straight myth shot willem dafoe standing pattinson beam light shooting eyes shot pattinson getting guts eaten seagulls end movie

"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right? LOST spoilers","I'm still not sure I really understood Jacob's plan. 

OK so Jacob and smoke monster are trapped on island. Check. Someone needs to contain smoke monster and *keep* him trapped on island or he will do bad things to world. Check. 

OK with plot so far. 

Island also has general magical properties which various groups have tried to harness/exploit over time, much to chagrin of Jacob, as this is all probably bad for containing smoke monster. Check. 

But why do they have to press the button to release energy? I mean I know why - so there isn't an explosion - but like how did we even get into that situation to begin with? It seems like pretty Dharma arrival that wasn't an issue?

And who cares anyway, because the explosion happened and didn't seem to have any serious effects. 

Also, why were people in hazmat suits?

And finally my biggest question: why were Jacob and the others always so cryptic and creepy and kidnappy? Like...I get the idea of testing potential guardians, but doesn't it seem like Jacob's setup was like....the worst possible way to do it?

Edit: Also, it was John Locke's dad's theory that the island was hell itself - ""Little hot for heaven, isn't it?""

"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right? LOST spoilers","Maybe, but it's sort of irrelevant. They weren't dead *the whole time* but they were dead for the entire 'flash sideways' during the last season and they wrote off the biggest mysteries of the show as 'magic'. Watching hours of flash sideways only to find out none of it mattered because the stakes were to get them together to hug in the afterlife is so convoluted and pointless the effect isn't really any different. Did anyone honestly watch LOST to see if the characters would reconnect in the afterlife? Of course not, but that's most peoples memory of the finale. The characters in the afterlife having a reunion.

The mysteries were interesting in the early seasons because the show felt otherwise pretty grounded. Finding out that it all comes down to analogous versions of god and the devil fighting over a magic light is so fucking lame.

***

edit: A lot of responses seem to be about how the show always had supernatural/magic elements- and it did. But you all might be forgetting how often the writers/producers of LOST promised that there were a scientific basis for why everything was happening and it would all be explained eventually.

 Damon Lindelof said the show was “firmly ensconced in science fact” and that everything in it had a “rational explanation in the real world we all function in."" They made these explicit promises multiple times during the first 3-4ish seasons of the show. That's why the ending is so reviled. They set the expectation, ended up going with 'magic', and then tried to gas light the audience by saying the show was always about the characters anyways and the answers never mattered.",Non-Spoiler,maybe sort irrelevant werent dead whole time dead entire flash sideways last season wrote biggest mysteries show magic watching hours flash sideways find none mattered stakes get together hug afterlife convoluted pointless effect isnt really different anyone honestly watch lost see characters would reconnect afterlife course thats peoples memory finale characters afterlife reunionthe mysteries interesting early seasons show felt otherwise pretty grounded finding comes analogous versions god devil fighting magic light fucking lameedit lot responses seem show always supernaturalmagic elements might forgetting often writersproducers lost promised scientific basis everything happening would explained eventually damon lindelof said show firmly ensconced science fact everything rational explanation real world function made explicit promises multiple times first ish seasons show thats ending reviled set expectation ended going magic tried gas light audience saying show always characters anyways answers never mattered
"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right? LOST spoilers","People got confused by the half season where the characters were dead the whole time. Which is a really dumb and lazy story to do for any period of time at all. We got hours of Lost where the characters were dead and in purgatory. So let’s not pretend the whole idea was a fan theory.

Does it really say that? Couple thoughts on this. 

First, half of Season 6 was explicitly stated to be essentially purgatory IIRC, as it's explained that the 'sideways' was a place for these characters to bop around before entering the 'great beyond'... ie, *a form of purgatory*... by Jack's father in the church-like place in the finale.  

Second, the whole show is about showing these characters' past sins, finding themselves trapped in a new location away from their old lives where people assume they are dead, and them dealing with said sins in some manner on the island. Absolutely some pretty strong purgatory vibes. 

All that said, I'm curious what the finale 'explicitly says the opposite"" on the matter, as it's been a long time since I've seen the finale.",Non-Spoiler,island purgatory finale explicitly says oppositedoes really say couple thoughts first half season explicitly stated essentially purgatory iirc explained sideways place characters bop around entering great beyond ie form purgatory jacks father churchlike place finale second whole show showing characters past sins finding trapped new location away old lives people assume dead dealing said sins manner island absolutely pretty strong purgatory vibes said im curious finale explicitly says opposite matter long time since ive seen finale

Their explanation is like saying Harry Potter isn’t about sorcery, it’s about magic which is a totally different thing! (It’s really not, it’s just semantics.)

So yes. I listened to the podcast Damon and Carlton did every week. It was the first podcast I ever listened to, in fact. And they told us over and over and over that the show wasn’t headed in that direction, that there was another explanation for what the island was and why they were all there…

I watched it when it originally aired, it was truly head and shoulders above anything else at the time.

The amount of time and energy my friends and I wasted coming up with theories and explanations about the shit going on on that island - the smoke monster, the hatch, the donkey wheel, NOT PENNY'S BOAT, the f**kin numbers!! - I would not change it for the world.

I played Lost: Via Domus just in case there was some shit in there would explain stuff. 

But, it declined in quality as the seasons progressed, and you could tell that the writers didn't know how to, or didn't want to, try to explain what was going on. The story had not been thought through - it was typical JJ ""Mystery Box"" Abrams stuff - and later seasons were sort of making it up on the fly. 

I never bought into them being dead the whole time or in purgatory - just because we had been shown too many hints to real world explanations of the mysteries - but it was certainly one of the theories that was banded about at the time. 

After the last episode I was just like ""ok then"" and it never felt satisfying.

I've watched it since and it stands up quite well and when binged you can connect the threads a bit easier.

When old ideas became too thin, they introduced another unsupported idea.  When it finally got into the last seasons the writers started making up reasons how everything tied up with dues ex machina over and over again.

Then there’s a spinoff show from the original, also called Lost. But it is NOT a sci fi show about nanobots or psychic kids (who hit growth spurts in real life.) It’s a character drama with psuedoreligious lore.   

But no one told people who watched the first two seasons that this was now a spinoff. So they kept watching, assuming everything would round back into sci fi form. When it didn’t, and the spinoff show ended on its own terms but left the first two seasons’ threads either abandoned or answered by basically saying “god(s) did it,” people got mad.

"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right?

I think they were overall correct that the character beats were more important than the actual answers, but where things felt uneven and where I think they missed the boat is that they split those into separate categories.

What the audience kept asking for was “answers” but what they actually wanted was “payoff” which are answers that are impactful and important to the characters and story.

I don’t think that the problem with the answers that we got was how grounded (or not) they were. It’s that they didn’t really tie in to the characters and their stories in any meaningful way. 

It could have been as ungrounded as they wanted if it felt like it fell perfectly in line with all of the character work and narrative build up that had happened up to that point.

But it kinda just didn’t. 

To be fair to Lost, it sits at an awkward point in time just as television was transitioning from the open-ended “just sit with the characters once a week” style of storytelling that had dominated most television up to that point to the tighter more over-arching narrative focus that has become the norm for most prestige shows now.

Lost *feels* like the latter in terms of style and premise but is structured more like the former on an overall basis, and it’s *really* hard to take the former structure and give it satisfying conclusion.

The button was a timed energy release of sorts, and when it wasn't pushed heavy electromagnetism goes off. This first not pushing the button caused the opening plane crash. 

Yes they traveled in time. That's what the whispers in the forest from ""the others"" were, along with other events. It asks the question of determinism. They went back in time to do a thing that produced an effect that would later loop on itself, regardless of what they did. 

The smoke was the ""bad god"", and he can impersonate the dead, as well as show a character their deepest failings / ""judge"" them. 

The island moved every so often because of that energy pocket. Eloise has a chart mapped of possible places it could be in. It can be moved with the wheel, although that ejects the person that turned it. A polar bear pushed it, ended up in the desert. Ben pushed it, ended up in the desert. 

The ""plane didn't crash"" bit *was* the Purgatory, where they go on to live flawed lives but they remember their connection to each other and what they went through and how that bettered them as people.

"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right? LOST spoilers","All of my cards on the table? S2 is rough the first time through. No way around that. 

But about 2/3 through the season there’s a big reveal and things fall back into place again. And seasons 3 and 4 are just amazing. The show picks back up and doesn’t quit until the end. 

And here’s what it has that Lost lacked- they knew the end before they started. Creator and show runner Sam Esmail envisioned it as a screenplay first, but when he started writing he had too much material. But he knew the major plot points for the whole series before they started working on the pilot. He knew it would be 4 or 5 seasons. (We got 4.) He knew where Elliot was going from the very beginning. 

There are references to the finale in the pilot, and there are scenes from the end in S1. And it all fits together so perfectly, going back to rewatch is an absolute trip. The second time through the show, it feels like the show actually changes. It’s so wild. 

I tell everyone that you haven’t seen the whole show until you’ve seen it twice, and I stand by that. And coming back to S2- it’s setting up new characters and storylines. It’s foggy and complicated when you don’t understand how it all fits together. But once you know the whole thing, I’d bet some of your favorite episodes will be from S2. You just have to see the whole picture. 

Here’s the thing. I’ve seen a lot of great tv. Lost was one of those shows. It changed what we thought tv could be. Breaking Bad was another. 

But Mr. Robot hits their heights, but it also *changed me as a person.* It did more for me than 20 years in the church and 10 years in therapy did for me.
