"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right? LOST spoilers","I love Lost. It is my favorite show ever and I always have to come defend it when people say they were dead the whole time or they didn't like the ending. I watched the show when it was airing. I couldn't wait to watch each episode and then go to different web sites and read people thoughts, look for Easter eggs and discuss each episode.

I did like the ending. When people say they left questions unanswered I really think it is more they didn't like the answers more then they didn't get answers. The answers came down to it was a magic island and I understand that not being satisfactory to some. But I just enjoyed the ride and didn't expect a huge payoff at the ends.

Below is a writeup I did to a thread in the past when someone was saying they ""got no answers and the ending made no sense""

This is basically my attempt to explain the ending of Lost.

>!\>!Ending of lost – First they were not dead the whole time.!<

>!Part of the story in season 6 of lost is the flash sideways. The flash sideways are “purgatory” or a meeting place after they all die before they go onto the afterlife. The losties go to the flash sideways after they die and meet with the most important people in their life before moving on. It does not mean they died at the same time or in the same way. For example Jack goes to “flash sideway land” after he dies on the island. Hurley goes many years later after protecting the island for many years. Locke goes after he is hung by Ben – Remember there is “no now here” in flash sideway land so time doesn’t matter, they all arrive after they die. (I saw you asked why. The answer is this is how the afterlife works in lost world. After you die you meet with the people who had the biggest impact on your life and you “move on” together).!<

>!The flash sideways land is the only place they are dead. The island is real; the things that happened on the island are real.!<

>!Background-!<

>!\-The island is the “center” of a magic light\*  that needs to be protected (More on the light later)!<

>!\-For the story we see the light is protected by two people – Jacob and MIB (man in black)!<

>!\-Jacob takes the job of protecting the light seriously.!<

>!\-Jacob also leads people to the island because he is curious about human behavior he is also looking for his eventual replacement to protect the light.!<

>!\-Jocob and MIB are really brothers. The previous protector of the light took them in and raised them as their mother.!<

>!\-MIB killed his mother, previous protector of the light. Jacob was mad and threw him into the light and he became a smoke monster. He can now take the form of dead people.!<

>!\-MIB hates living on the island and is looking for a way off.!<

>!\-MIB needs to kill Jacob to leave the island, but the mother made it impossible for Jacob/MIB to hurt each other.!<

>!\-If this happens no one would be there to protect the light and this is dangerous for the world.!<

>!Okay, so that is your magic island and the background for everything that happens. Like I said, I understand if you don’t like the magic island. And I agree without that it does not make sense without the magic.!<

>!(Dharma, Black Rock, Flight 815 and everyone else we saw on the island was manipulated to come there by Jacob to either study them, have them help protect the light or check if they could be his replacement.)!<

>!The ending of the show was basically how the MIB/Jacob situation played out. MIB showed up as Locke, who was dead, and tricked Ben into killing Jacob. Jacob passed protection on to Jack who was then made changes to the light to make MIB mortal and kill him. Jack dies, but first passes the protecting of the light on to Hurley.!<

>!That is my readers digest summation of the show and the ending. It has been several years since I watched the show so I may have missed details.!<

>!Okay about the Light - what it is and why does it need protection.!<

>!I believe this is a detail they intentionally didn’t answer, because they wanted people to figure it out. But I believe the light is the source of “time”. At one point someone describes the light as “something everyone has, but everyone wants more of.”  The fact the light is the force that results in time passing explains the time travel, moving island, exotic matter, strange electromagnetic properties of the island. – but like I said this is my theory on the light. It was never explicitly answered.!<!<",Spoiler
"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right? LOST spoilers","My beef with LOST was how the show runners kept making claims around “this is how it is/will be/wont be” and they threw out their own rules. 

It could also be that clever watchers hypothesized things correctly and they didn’t want to give it away (like >!time travel!< ). Maybe showrunners learned it’s better to just say “wait and see” instead of “no, we are not doing that.” [And then doing exactly that](https://www.tv-calling.com/quotes-from-lost-showrunners-carlton-cuse-and-damon-lindelof/). 

I feel like LOST was a big “phenomenon” of its time (maybe parallels to GOT in that regards?), but it definitely had strong fans and strong detractors. 

I think I’ll have to put it back on and watch again, because the mystery of the early seasons was so good.

(Also, I posted once and automod flagged it because I didn’t do spoiler tags correctly, I dig that attention to comment detail!)",Spoiler

That’s funny too because I read the creator would ensure Betty wouldn’t be in any previews in later seasons in order to surprise viewers when she was even in an episode. Weird how differently he treated the two characters.  

He also wanted to create false episode premises out of the previews by editing the clips in a way that made it seem like an episode would be about something or fit into certain themes and then the actual episode would be something entirely different, but they found that difficult and ultimately went for nonsense most of the time instead. I don’t remember that episode but I wonder if it largely wasn’t actually about >!the proposal!< despite making it seem like it would be, or if that wasn’t the actual important thing that was going on. Might’ve been though, what a weird thing to spoil. Did they make it seem like it would be a big romantic episode and then it wasn’t at least?

It's because it's Iran. It's the authoritarian Iranian regime that's curbing freedoms and stopping its citizens emigrating to the US. Noor made it to NYC because she's working for the regime. She's still, in a sense, on their turf, and she's obviously not free, even there.

First, maybe not a catching the shark moment but more of a successful pivot was the end of season one getting totally derailed by the events of Captain America: Winter Soldier (back when the show had some pretense of being part of the cinematic universe)

SG-1 sort of jumped the shark when they replaced Daniel Jackson with Jonas, but Jackson returned the next season. I say ""sorta"" because the Jonas season was actually a good run of episodes.

Also SG-1 replacing RDA with half the cast of Farscape was a good move. It freshened the cast, added a fun romantic screwball comedy angle and brought in a new villain with new stakes

Atlantis brought in Jason Mamoa and the team leveled up, making the show a lot more interesting. Unfortunately season 3 screwed up by >!killing both Carson and Weir!< and I don't think it really recovered.

"What shows have ""Caught the Shark"" as opposed to ""Jumped the Shark""? i.e. They made a choice that looks Big and Bad and Misplaced and it ended up working (inspired by Fargo FX series. Major spoiler safely redacted in body of post)","I feel like ""caught the shark"" is the wrong phrase. To my mind it feels like that should be the term for when a show (a) was regarded as having jumped the shark and then (b) later did something that caused people to go ""Oh, I get it now"" and what had been regarded as jumping the shark is re-evaluated, What you're talking about seems more like ""owned the shark"".

For example, if Doctor Who had revealed that the timeless child was actually the Master's origin story, then I really think that people would have a totally different opinion about the timeless child as a concept. So, this I would describe as catching the shark.

As to actual example of *this* version of catching the shark? I guess The Wire sort of makes sense. I'm not sure at which point after S2 finishes that S2 makes sense, but it does eventually happen.

In terms of ""owning the shark"", i.e. what you're calling catching the shark, I think I agree with Fring's >!death!< in Breaking Bad. It should feel ridiculous but it never does. Another example would be Agents of SHIELD which literally blew up its whole concept about 2/3 of the way through its first series. Everyone agrees this was a good idea (but the stuff before that moment is seriously over-hated).

I'm a bit torn about Supernatural which someone else also mentioned. I think for most people introducing angels was owning the shark, but for me Supernatural before the angels show up is pretty crap. In other words Castiel's arrival is more like growing the beard than owning the shark. Though that's a bit unfair to S3. The urgency the writer's strike gave the show did wonders for it.",Spoiler

&#x200B;

I really wanted to like this but man...it was rough. I'll start with the ending. Hands down one of the worst executed ""twists"" I've ever seen. A good twist should leave you smacking your head and saying ""Oh damn. Of course. How could a miss that!"" Think >!Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense!< or >!Tyler Durden in Fight Club!< or >!Norman Bates in Psycho.!< There is zero plot reasoning set up in the preceding 7+ hours that set up Jayden as the killer and there was zero narrative reasoning for why her being the killer makes the story better. At the end of The Usual Suspects, I'm sitting there staring at the screen thinking ***mind blown*** while at the end of this show I'm sitting there staring at the screen thinking, OK. Whatevs ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

If they had gone with Rusty covering up the murder that his wife committed, that is interesting and compelling and once it is revealed you look back at things like his reaction to her and the bartender and his losing control on the stand and it all makes sense. The ending they went with is just really bad storytelling. It doesn't connect to rest of the story. And the rest of the story was SEVEN HOURS LONG! It's not like they had to squeeze out something in a 115 minute movie. They could have taken any number of the countless pointless minutes long shots of a character staring at something and used that to lay a little groundwork for what was to come and character development for Jayden. This was like watching The Sixth Sense and at the end it is revealed that >!Bruce Willis' wife is a ghost.!< You'd be sitting there like, OK. What was the point of all of that? 

And about those excruciatingly long shots that lead to and signified nothing and added just as much to the story. This could easily have been a 4 episode show. Or hell, if you want to re-make it with a modern take as another movie, just do that. But this was waayyyyy to long of a show. 

My final thoughts on things that I had a problem with. The lawyer having an electrical problem with his heart was the cheapest, most sophomoric attempt at building suspense and tension that I've seen in a long time. Rusty representing himself after that event was one of the dumbest, most unrealistic things I've seen right up until they decided to have him give his own closing statement, which immediately became the dumbest, most unrealistic thing I've seen in a long time. 

Now, it did have things I liked. Carolyn. You're going to go with eight 50+ minute episodes, start it earlier in the timeline. Let me see Carolyn cook. Let me see some crazy. Let me see her being a bad ass bitch. She's the most interesting character in the story but she's dead before we begin. Tommy Malto. Gimme more Tommy Malto! Give me a second season revolving around Tommy's next case and how he's trying to win back the love and respect of his cat after disappointing his furry feline friend by losing the Rusty Sabitch case so spectacularly. The cat's obvious utter contentment it felt for Tommy was probably the 3rd best thing about the entire series. The Mya character. She was like having the biggest, coolest, most explosive firework on the Fourth of July and not shooting it off. If she had jumped in the lead position for the defense after Raymond had his case of indigestion, I feel like that would have fixed like 75% of the problems the show had. 

But the ending? There was no fixing that mess. All that said, I'll be back for season 2.",Spoiler
'Presumed Innocent' finale discussion [spoilers],"Hmm, torn. On the one hand, I'm not sure if I like the outcome. What daughter would realistically kill somebody for fear of breaking up Mom and Dad?

On the other hand, who cares? Show was brilliantly acted all around. As far as Bad Robot ending shenanigans go, this was hardly the worst stunt they've pulled.

It wasn't really realistic for a DA to have been investigating the crime; that's a minor point that take away from my suspension of disbelief but other than that the overall story was still plausible. I also didn't like how the killer got away with no consequences at the end.

Apple’s ‘No Villain Clause’ for iPhones On-Screen: All About the Alleged Rule,"That's not entirely clear to me.

Looking it up, I see [this 2012 Business Insider article](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-product-placements-in-tv-and-movies-2012-8) that says while Apple hasn't paid for product placement since the 90's, they would happily supply free devices to movies and shows. It does not mention any conditions Apple would supply and allow or forbid their logo to be shown.

That article references [this Washington Post article from 2008](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401670.html) which notes in the show 24, the good guys use Apple and the bad guys use Windows, but again no reference to any explicit rule.



As far as I can find through my brief google search, Rian Johnson is the originating source of this story, and obviously he had motive to make this into a red herring. I have no idea if he made it up out of whole cloth or if this was this a rule only known to prop departments that he was actually told and he wanted to be clever with it.

Arcane S2 (wtf) (no spoilers),"Season 2 feels very different in comparsion to Season 1.

Season 1 had the peak of the unique artstyle, artistic approach, and an emotional story with a limited set of characters. Season 2 bloats the artistic approach by adding music video scenes to grab us emotionally. The songs were good, but they overdid it. Instead of 5 minute music shows, they could have add meaningful lines to drive the story forward, and the story suffers in S2.

Season 1 ""just"" had two Maincharacters, and a small cast as a sideplot to show us why the city is divided. Now in S2 every side character wants a piece of that cake, but everyone wants a bigger piece than the others. Sadly, some characters development suffer from the pacing, sometimes complete missing for some episodes.

"'Shrinking' is a perfect TV show, can't change my mind","I think I'm on the same wavelength here, where I still like it and find it funny if not a little cringe, but mostly I find myself getting pulled out of it when I disagree or agree but question some of its moral takes, because it does feel very smug about them--like if you use enough psychobabble it *must* be the correct thing, and you'd be wrong to think otherwise, it's just science. I remind myself it's still a bit of a fantastical show in the same vein as Scrubs or Ted Lasso, but it does still annoy me at times. Spoilers ahead!

>!For example, I'm a man and some of my best friends are married women who I have not nearly enough sexual interest in to even consider trying to get them to cheat, not to mention the fact that I wouldn't do anything when I do. It seemed to imply in the episode where Liz kisses Mac for a few ~~Mississippi~~ Cincinnati that men only befriend women for sex. The characters we look to for expertise in the show, Harrison Ford especially, pretty much says that men don't have women friends that they're not trying to fuck. However, obviously Jimmy and Liz are friends, Brian and Jimmy are friends, and so on and so forth, so it seems like what they were really trying to say is that men don't do the things that Mac does, specifically, unless they're trying to cheat. But that is not how it came across to me. It sounded like the old tired ""all men are secretly homewreckers"" thing mixed with ""all women secretly want to have their homes wrecked"" thing.!<

>!Another example is how they all convinced Brian that he should adopt a kid by basically telling him ""all of your fears and unfounded and you are wrong about yourself and you will enjoy having a kid."" I think they basically gaslit him into this viewpoint, and I happen to want kids myself for basically all of the same reasons they gave, but if I had doubts, I'd want them properly explored and explained because having children is life-shatteringly monumental a decision, not something you can just be like ""oh I guess you're right"" about. Relationships rightfully end because there is no compromising on this issue, you can't have half a kid or condemn your partner to being a single parent while at the same time you pretend you're still in a relationship. They explore this a little in the episode following, but it still seems like remaining childfree is being presented not as a legitimate choice but as a pathology born of fear and immaturity.!<

>!Finally, and this is ironically the easiest for me to forgive, is how easy forgiveness is portrayed, whether that's Summer and Alice, or Roy Kent and Alice, or even Jimmy's patient whom he goaded into attempted murder and himself. There isn't time or space on the show to really dig into the heavy pain that these things cause, as the show is focused on the positive and how to arrive at happy endings, not on exploring the depths of that pain. But I still have to stop and convince myself that the show is supposed to be happy when it has these very unhappy plot points that I'd naturally expect a lot more rage and sadness and negativity around. Sometimes that negativity is played for laughs, e.g. Summer making a TikTok video with a catchy auto tune, and it was a pretty funny bit, but it is so cartoonishly fantasy-land happy-go-lucky to me that it almost felt like it was ignoring this whole other dimension of human emotion in order to just be like ""it'll be okay!"" Yes, it will, but it is hard work to get there for most people. It almost feels flippant to the people who are fighting through their conflicts with other people to just have them say ""I love you"" after pouting in each other's general direction for a bit.!<

Reacher review: Binge-worthy take on your favorite airport novel hero,"I've tried reading the Reacher novels by Lee Child and I gave up. One of the things I just can't let go and maybe this is just my hang up is how many unbelievable coincidences he relies on to move the story forward. 

I had a creative writing teacher in high school who said something that has stuck with me since then. He said it was sometimes okay to use coincidence to create problems for the protagonist to overcome but never okay to use it to solve those problems. Coincidence should only be used sparingly no matter what and the plot shouldn't rely on it. He said it was a tool used by lazy writers to solve situations where they have painted themselves into a corner or don't know how to move the story forward by other means. I whole heartedly agree with this and even then the coincidence should be believable. When I see it on screen it stands out like a flaming dumpster to me.

>!The entire story hinges on the fact that Jack Reacher has a brother whom he hasn't spoken to for years and didn't know where he lived or worked. But somehow by completely unbelievable coincidence we're supposed to accept that Reacher just happened to randomly get off the bus in the same small Georgia town where his brother was murdered only hours earlier a few yards away? And he is almost immediately arrested for said murder? This was something that stood out for me in the book and they didn't fix it in the Amazon Prime show either.!< 

>!How hard would it have been to just say that the brothers stayed in touch even though it had been years since they had seen each other? It would have made perfect sense that Reacher ended up in town because he was supposed to meet his brother there. Perhaps his brother could have even asked Reacher for help with his investigation? It would have made a lot more sense than how it actually unfolded. It also would have made sense why he was arrested for the murder because of his connection to the victim. Pretty much everything else would have progressed mostly unchanged from that point on.!<

I have this same complaint about Dexter. How many times was Dexter almost caught but some convoluted string of events would occur and he would skate by mostly in the clear? Conversely I always admire Breaking Bad because they did the opposite. Walter White would often end up in bad situations due to his own choices that seemed impossible to overcome. But he somehow always managed to get the upper hand because he would use his intellect and think his way out of problems. Coincidence was something that rarely occurred on Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul. That level of writing is what makes those programs superior television. Reacher...not so much. Although it is fine pandemic binge material.",Spoiler
Reacher review: Binge-worthy take on your favorite airport novel hero,"I mean, I love the books, but Reacher's leaps of logic at times are absolutely silly. It apes at what Doyle did with Sherlock, but I think ""Reacher being the smartest guy in the room"" is the weakest part of the formula. Because since no one can figure out what he needs to figure out in reality, it means the author has to write nearly everyone else as pretty damn stupid sometimes.

I think it was in Night School when >!they are trying to figure out what a particular piece of Army hardware that was stolen actually is. They know the name ""Davey Crockett"" is involved somehow.

Orson Welles said that it's the best kind of character to play in a play because in the first two acts everyone is mentioning Mr. Woo and how scary and important and terrifying he is before Mr. Woo makes a single appearance before the interval.  Then, during the break the audience goes to get a drink and say, ""oh, how good is that Mr Woo, so threatening etc."".

In the game >!Abby!< is honestly that character for the first half and the 2 faction leaders in the 2nd half.",Spoiler
The Last of Us Season 2 | Review Megathread,"I'm with you. I really resonated with this part of the Kotaku review as I felt this critique applied equally to Season 1:

""Overall, the show seems scared of silence. Unlike a player experiencing the game, the viewer isn’t meant to inhabit a specific viewpoint and act out the scene. As a result, it seems the show’s creators have decided that it has to lay everything bare, leaving no action, motive, or regret to the imagination, just in case you weren’t sure that everyone here is complicit in the grief-driven cycle of violence that’s being perpetuated. *The Last of Us* season two doesn’t just want you to feel empathy for both its heroines; it wants to make sure you understand that this is the point. You might feel no sympathy for Abby, you may think Ellie has gone too far, but that’s not for you to decide. The show already knows the lesson it has to teach, and the collateral damage is that no one talks to each other like they aren’t aware that someone is watching them.""

For example, in TLOU season 1,>!when Joel and Ellie stop and talk in the FEMA camp in the finale, Joel's comment to Ellie that ""It wasn't time that did it"" was really unnecessary. Wasted opportunity to let the actors *act* and allow the audience to figure out why Joel was finally ready to tell Ellie that particular story. !<IMO, Better Call Saul is a great example of this with its ""show, don't tell"" writing. Plenty of unspoken moments in scenes that advance characters' storylines and motives perfectly without beating the viewer over the head with on-the-nose dialogue.",Spoiler

>!The movie starts with the FF living in this 60s retro futuristic universe where they are the main heroes and protectors. They are essentially celebrities who are adored by the public and appear in a TV show where they explain how they defeated Mole Man. Sue is pregnant with Franklin and the 4 of them work as space explorers for the government. But there's something off about the family, like a secret they are keeping, creating a tense atmosphere.!<

>!So Reed gets hard at work on something, and it's made to seem like he's working on a device to stop Galactus. But the masks fall and the big mid-movie twist happens, and we learn that Reed is working on a Multiversal portal to get them back to their home universe, 616!<

>!Then we get their origin story (the real one): the 4 of them were scientists/explorers back on Earth 616 when they accidentally caused a rift in space-time which took them to the retro-futuristic universe they are living in now and the radiation they experienced when the rift opened gave them their powers. When they arrived in this new universe, they used their powers to stop Mole Man from an attack in New York which made them celebrities. So with no way to go back to their home world, they just accepted their fate. But Reed has been trying to make a portal to take them back all this time and he is even more motivated now that this world is about to be devoured.!<

>!Reed succeeds and the F4 are now posed with a moral dilemma: stay here and try to save this world that adores them and sees them as heroes with a large probability to fail, or just abandon them and go back to their world. The Surfer comes back to warn the F4 that time is running out and she learns about the portal and the Multiverse. She goes back to Galactus to tell him that there is a whole Multiverse of worlds out there which he can devour, and we learn that Galactus is sick and needs to eat more planets, so he believes the FF and their portal is key to his survival.!<

>!The F4 decide to stay in this universe and help save it, and Galactus makes his first steps in Manhattan, as the third act starts. But that's where the plot leak stops.

(GOTG3 spoilers) The Quill-Gamora resolution was perfect,">	Peter finally accepting the losses he’s suffered and that this new Gamora is not the same one he fell in love with was both satisfying and absolutely crushing. 


>!Gamora: *I bet we were a lot of fun.*!<

>!Peter (choked up): *Oh man. You have no idea.*!<

It had me tearing up at multiple points in the movie. This is the magic of both Marvel and James Gunn. What Marvel did with the Infinity Saga was give us this interwoven universe of storylines and characters that gave us a really broad reason to connect the characters apart from their movies. It enabled us to more clearly make connections from a sentiment in one movie as it is expressed in another, even if it isn’t intended as an explicit link.

An example, for me, that I couldn’t stop thinking of after walking out of the theater following *GotG vol 3:*

>	Vision: “But…a thing isn’t beautiful because it lasts. It is a privilege to be among them.”

That’s from *Avengers: Age of Ultron* and it’s talking about the human race, but it can just as easily be applied to love. What Peter and Gamora had wasn’t beautiful because of the all-too-brief time in which they had to live it. It’s beautiful because of so. Many. Reasons.

With regards to James Gunn, and with no disrespect intended to the other filmmakers - just an incredible roster of talent - who have brought their abilities to the MCU, from the beginning the *Guardians* have been the only set of movies/characters capable of generating their own heart and soul simply by existing together. You could make a case for Tony, but it wasn’t until Infinity War that he reeeeally hit his stride, and it was the driving force of Thanos that caused it. 

Gunn is a unique talent who was given freedom to hone his abilities at Marvel, and it’s such a shame Disney fumbled things as badly as they did with his old tweets/firing. Because if anyone was a natural successor to Feige it was always him, and while some DC holdouts might bitch and moan about him not being Zack Snyder, all it will take is a couple of movies at most. Because he creates characters you can’t help but care about. And they’re not just comedic throwaways, which has always been the most absurd criticism. They’re funny, but that humor is always hiding something deeper - it’s always a defense mechanism. 

And one final note on Chris Pratt. He’s become a lightning rod for controversy for years, despite no real evidence to support Elliot Page’s initial takedown of him on Twitter. I know the Church he apparently does attend (Zoe Church in LA) was founded by a former Hillsong pastor, but Pratt has made his beliefs on matters of “love is love and people should be free to be with who they want” very clear. He’s also not tied into one denomination, having had his daughter baptized at a Catholic Church preferred by Katherine Schwarzenegger and her family, and fairly recently made comments on a podcast suggesting (IIRC) that he’s become much more spiritual and personal in his Christianity, because he’s not a fan of the way Christians at large and the institutions promoting it are failing some of Jesus’ most basic teachings. Like kindness.

Phew. All of that is a prelude to say, Chris Pratt can really fucking act, and it gets lost in the weeds of all this nonsense. A few more years and life experience have given him the gravitas needed to really sell those emotional moments, he’s got the comedy chops, but he’s just so relatable on screen. I find myself wishing he could take a career path similar to that of…Christ, now I dunno. Maybe a Chris Evans? I’d love to see him working with guys like Rian Johnson, or on some smaller flicks. The blockbusters will still be there. Not everything has to be *The Tomorrow War* or *The Terminal List.*

Phew. Sorry for the long post. Great topic.",Spoiler

"Iman vellani on fate of [spoiler] in MoM & more ... this girl is def the choosen one 😂 , she's just so smart like her character","The problem stems more so from the universes surrounding the different 616’s.

In pulling all of these universes over to the movie multiverse rather than the comic multiverse, they are screwing over all these comic stories.

Sure, most people can easily wrap their heads around the fact that both the movie and comic universes are labeled 616 despite being separate, yet what does not make sense is severing all of the links between previous alternate universes and the comics.

Wholesome video of Florence Welch watching Guardians 3 and reacting to spoiler,"Thanks so much for asking! I can only have so many characters in the playlist description, I would've put all of this there if I could.

Since the conceit for the playlist is listening to the Guardians' story as it unfolds, I omitted songs that were part of the released Awesome Mixes that didn't actually play during the canonical story (also the reason why ""Vol 1"" ends with ""O-o-oh Child"" rather than ""I Want You Back"", since every song after ""Child"" actually plays from the Vol 2 cassette. And same reason why I start the Zune section at ""Father and Son""). I didn't want to just leave those songs out entirely though, since they are part of the canonical Awesome Mixes (just not heard diegetically), so I just bumped them to the bottom. Those include songs that play over the credits, songs that were only used in trailers, and my one little grey area in the list is that I also include songs that Gunn has specified would have been in the movies under other circumstances. So in order (with Vol 3 spoilers hidden):

\- Guardians Inferno: This was a [gag](https://youtu.be/3MMMe1drnZY) included on the Vol 2 home release, and you actually can hear it play at the end of the credits. Since it's so meta, I figured it was a good one to indicate the change in nature of the songs. I stuck to movie order after that.

\- Spirit in the Sky: Only appeared in Vol 1 trailers

\- Flash Light: Only appeared in Vol 2 credits

\- Fox on the Run: Only appeared in Vol 2 trailers

\- Koinu no Carnival: >!Plays over the Counter-Earth family's radio, so not canonically part of the Zune's music!<

\- I Will Dare: The only song on AMV3 that I didn't hear in the movie at all (I took notes to make sure I had the Zune order right lol). I'll pester Gunn's Twitter to hopefully get an answer on whether this was used or not. It's not in either of the main trailers either.

\- Draw the Line, Train in Vain, Caught in a Dream, New York Groove: These are the four songs Gunn provided to the Russo bros, in addition to Rubberband Man, as options for Guardians accompaniments. Since theoretically, any of them appearing was just as likely as Rubberband Man, I included them here - but lower than all the ones that were official Awesome Mix material.

\- Russian Roulette: I actually just added this literally this morning, after you'd already replied. James tweeted that this is the first and only time he couldn't use a song that he wanted to because of rights issues. So had it not been wrapped up in legal shenanigans, there's a good chance it would have been part of Vol 3.

\- Cruel to Be Kind: It's the one song James has specified that he wanted to put in every single Awesome Mix and couldn't find a place.

There are plenty of songs that could kind of fall into some of these categories: James published ""Meredith Quill's Complete Awesome Mix"" over the pandemic and it's full of songs he'd considered or was considering for Guardians stories. But since I wanted to be more specific to the movies as we know them (and because that playlist already exists - it's also worth checking out!), I only went with songs that were close enough to James' vision that he's called them out in particular in interviews.

I did leave out the Holiday Special songs, but for what I feel is good reason. The obvious one is that the Christmas songs don't quite fit with the tone of the rest of the playlist. But also, the songs of the HS ""Awesome Mix"" are of a very different nature from the usual Awesome Mixes. All but 3 of the songs don't really play from the Zune at all: instead they're playing from sources on Earth, or just straight-up needle drops that aren't tied to any background music or Zune or anything. There are even original songs that are performed live, so those don't come attached to the Zune either. Since so much of the music isn't Zune-based, it makes me question whether the three songs that play when on board the Bowie or in Knowhere are actually Zune-based too. Maybe they are, and if so, it would still be a departure for the tone of the playlist (although they wouldn't be completely out of the question). But if they aren't playing from the Zune, then they wouldn't need to be on the playlist as I envisioned it anyway. Maybe that's another question I can ask Gunn: if those three songs are actually playing from the Zune or not.

Thanks again for checking out the playlist!",Spoiler

[Very small spoiler for Thor 4] A really interesting point raised about Valkyrie's commercial endeavours. Thoughts?,"Yeah, it's honestly quite a mess likely becuase of conflicting ideas between the Movies' and Shows' Producers.

But it's not even a bad thing. It just shows that Marvel finally gave their Producers more of a free hand to do the best they can, without having to limit themselves based on each other.

>""Was Loki or Wanda or Strange or Spiderman the one who broke the universe?""

This is a question that is still beyond me, because Feigi literally said like 50 times ""Ever since the Multiverse was opened at the end of the Loki Series."" Which to me is quite obvious what opened it up. It also supports the fact that ""What If"" was scheduled from the start, to happen after ""Loki.""

>Phases 1-3 were, more or less, a single story, carefully constructed to make sure it all fit together. Phase 4 isn't that anymore: it's more concerned with letting the individual movies/shows shine. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Exactly.

Plus, I honestly love that they've started expanding all the topics and themes that were earlier locked only to the certain Movies and Characters.
Like the theme of Gods and Thor - expanded to ""Moon Knight"" and ""Black Panther."" 

(little Spoiler for ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" here):
>!And I honestly like that there is a logical explanation as to why the Egiptian Gods were not in Thor 4 - because the Omnipotent City is a Physical Realm, where the Gods we see have their Physical Forms.

Hawkeye’s interactions and relationships with female characters (no spoilers),"Personally I felt that Clint's introduction was way too underdeveloped in The Avengers. This guy just crashes in and we're supposed to believe that he has the skill and ability to hang with: a Super Soldier, a literal god, a guy with a futuristic rocket suit, and a guy with Hulk powers? Even Natasha could be explained to have her powers from the Red Room program. We never get any explanation for how he got that good and he's regularly getting beat up in fights that are difficult enough for Tony and Steve.

Okay now imagine all of that written in sarcasm font. It's true but literally no one complained about that when the character was first introduced.

In counterpoint, we see Kate: >!suffer some serious trauma as a child when she lost her beloved father in the Chitauri invasion; witness Clint be a badass shooting Chitauri out of the sky and saving her life; Kate resolving to protect her family by following his lead and asking her mom for a bow and arrow; completing two trick shots to make a bell ring; and bringing home enough martial arts medals over the course of her life that she's now running out of space.!<

>!\>!Agree on all of this. The show was about wandas emotions and how she dealt with them. The ending was so...not that. She fights Agatha and then becomes the Scarlett Witch and now she’s fine with her emotions except she actually isn’t based on the end credits scene. Like the aspect of her never got resolved. Episode 8 showed everything that was bringing her down and you’d expect, like Agatha said in that episode, the only way forward is backwards sometimes. But Wanda didn’t learn or grow from her flashbacks at all it seems. The thing that actually causes her to put down the hex is seeing all the towns people begging her to help.!<

>!And tbh the fight itself was very meh. She hits Agatha with a car and chases her to shoot red energy at her to start. Seeing her give Agatha nightmare was cool but didn’t advance anything. Then when they’re back in reality she just shoots more energy at her until her tunes are set up. And then it’s over. I didn’t feel it was that creative. Even with the kids in danger there never felt like the threat was that serious!<

>!And the ending felt cliche. “You don’t know what you’ve started/done”. “You’ll need me” “If I need you I’ll find you”. I feel like I’ve seen that so many times before.!<

The fire debt has been repaid, so it would be game-on the next time they see each other regardless, I'd say.

Hawkeye and Black Widow have both got that weird plot armour buff where they just survive loads of instant death scenarios.

I could understand some whining if there was a very obvious distinction made between two versions of a character for the purposes of actual character work and story. Batman was nerfed for Nolan’s The Dark Knight trilogy and it makes perfect sense because of that gritty universe. Context is everything.

Yes, you could say that dude would lose in a straight fight to Affleck’s Batman. That’s a very clear and obvious storytelling difference: Affleck’s Batman is not only built like a tank, but his character mindset is one that is meant to take on gods. Christian Bale’s Batman is a just an above average fighter. It’s weird because both of them are human yet still there’s a clear difference in terms of how they’re MEANT to be. They’re different characters in massively different contexts.

Cool. Only THEN can you whine about inconsistencies. But there’s no evidence that Spidey has ever been treated like that. There isn’t a version of Spidey I can think of that is meant to be any weaker or stronger than what we’ve seen so far. They’re all vaguely in the same area.

We also see Reed Richards, but we don’t know yet if a similar version of this Reed Richards exists in the 616 universe. Since the other 5 Illuminati members looked like their familiar counterparts, I’m assuming John Krasinski has the job and it wasn’t just a cameo based off of fan casting, but this could have also just been a variant of Reed Richards from that universe (Ioan Gruffudd/Miles Teller were the only actors who didn't return to portray their previous character).

"[Spoilers] Seeing quite a few fan theories about the trailer, just remember to take some of the info presented with a grain of salt","Here’s my counter-argument:

1. The multiverse was already established to exist way back in Doctor Strange. Mordo even mentions to Strange the dangers of messing with the Time Stone.

“Temporal manipulations can create branches in time. Unstable dimensional openings, spatial paradoxes, time loops!”

Fury said that a tear in our dimension was created by the Snap, which utilized the Time Stone.

2. Fury wouldn’t believe Beck’s story without full concrete proof. Something like a tear in the universe would definitely catch his attention.

3. The Infinity Gauntlet with the Stones has the power to create a hole in our dimension. >!Thanos even tried to create a whole new universe in Endgame when he saw that no one prospered when he won!<.

4. For how they handle Mysterio, they could go many ways. In the comics, Beck wanted to be a hero but became a villain due to Spider-Man’s interference in his plans. He staged all of his heroic deeds so he could get the credit. For Beck’s backstory, he could’ve been a hero on his Earth but did more morally questionable actions that Peter disagreed with, turning him into a villain in the climax. He could’ve been a villain on his Earth but wanted to change for the better on another Earth, but couldn’t because of Spider-Man.

There's plenty of time for these twists to unfold and be reacted to rather than cramming a resolution into the last episode like so many other Disney+ shows have done.

"If Kang isn't behind the TVA and it really is a Loki, I don't think it's any variant who won against the Avengers in 2012. [Minor Episode 5 Spoilers]","I made the mistake of delving into Kang wiki this morning.

The more I read, the more I'm convinced Kang is as good of a possibility as God King Loki is.

Granted, Wiki might not be entirely accurate but these points stuck out to me:

1. Kang is Immortus in one version
2. Immortus is offered residence in Limbo by the Time Keepers
3. The residence in Limbo is referred to as a fortress (>!what were Loki and Sylvie approaching!<?)
4. Limbo is possibly >!the place beyond Alioth!<
5. Ravonna and Kang's well known romance in the comics
6. There's several other ties that makes it reaaaaaalllly hard to not consider Kang being the headline bad guy

None of this is me attempting to hype, or act, like I figured anything out. I have limited comics knowledge. Simply going off of what I've seen in all 5 episodes so far, and what I read online about certain characters. It's certainly a possibility Kang is related to this entire Loki series.",Spoiler
Spoiler: The ending of Loki makes sense because...,"Counterpoint:  Loki Season 2 does not make sense (Disclaimer:  It is a fantastic show though!)

1. >!The timelines dying doesn't actually make sense in the universe.  If the timelines would die without being shepherded, then all of the timelines would've already died since Kang and the Loom didn't exist until deep into each timeline's evolution.  For instance, Victor didn't exist until billions of years into the timeline, so there were already infinite timelines that were obviously thriving.!<
2. >!The TVA doesn't make sense.  Time is simply an ordered series of events relative to an entity experiencing it or observing it.  If the TVA exists outside of time, then it's an unordered series of events, and anyone can send their consciousness to any event point at the TVA, ala Loki's timeslipping.  So either the show is fundamentally broken, or everyone at the TVA thinks they're outside of time when they really aren't.!<
3. >!Loki's timeslipping doesn't make sense.  He only time slips within the context of the show.  He could've, and should've, just jumped back to when he was a small child, told Odin what was happening hundreds or thousands of years ago, and Odin could've mustered the combined forces of huge numbers of very advanced civilizations to solve the problem.  A human built the loom largely alone, it's a safe bet the combined forces of the universe could've done better.!<
4. >!Then there's the problem of Loki's freezing time for targeted entities.  All he had to do was freeze time for the Loom, then he had infinite time to solve the problem of infinite timelines!<
5. >!On top of that, if Loki is able to do it, then \*all\* Lokis are able to do it.  So he could use timeslipping and the temp pads to have infinite Lokis freeze time for the Loom and have infinite time to solve infinite timelines!<

"In Alien (1979), Ash is observing the chestburster embryo inside Kane on his monitor, which he turns off when Ripley appears. While they talk, she tries to look in his microscope but Ash tells her to stop. After she leaves, he drinks a white fluid. Full details and spoilers in comments...","**Full explanation, with spoilers for Alien (1979):**

*Some of these observations may be unique to the Director’s Cut:*

>!In the film, Ash is an android pretending to be the science officer of the USCSS Nostromo, but the company has placed him there to ensure a xenomorph is returned to them for weapons research—even at the expense of the human crew’s lives. There are several examples of him enabling the alien to escape (for example, by preventing the crew from attacking the chestburster just as it emerges) or hindering the crews efforts to find and destroy it.!<

>!While “collating” his results from the medical scan of Kane, who is still “facehugged,” the camera focuses on Ash at his workstation. He is studying an X-ray (or similar scan) that clearly shows the head and eyes of a developing embryo, which will develop into a chestburster (and later xenomorph) that kills the rest of the crew. This means that he is aware something is growing inside Kane and likely expects it to emerge at some point (bottom right image; red arrow).!<

>!A few moments later, Ripley surprises him while he works and he quickly turns off his monitor so she can’t see what he’s doing. During their discussion, he gives vague answers that are technically correct but not actionable or useful for stopping the alien.!<

>!While he talks, Ripley looks into his microscope but he quickly tells her to “please don’t do that,” so she stops—possibly preventing her from seeing his samples or gaining any useful info (top right image).!<

>!After she leaves, Ash drinks a cup of white liquid that looks like milk, but that is later revealed to be the same circulation fluid (“blood”) that runs through the system of androids in the Alien universe. When Ash is killed later in the movie, his damaged internal systems spray this fluid from his severed neck (top left image).!<

>!Once the facehugger detaches from Kane, Ash radios Dallas and Ripley to come to the medical bay, without telling them what to expect. Once inside, they begin to search for the detached facehugger, and ash presses the button to seal the doors while they are still inside. While the facehugger ends up already being dead, this suggests that Ash thought it might still be alive and wanted Dallas and Ripley to come to the medical bay unprepared, where they might happen upon the facehugger. Since Ash is not alive, this could have allowed him to see how the facehugger responds to human hosts, and possibly to impregnate more of them. Closing the door would prevent the facehugger from escaping, but also prevent Dallas and Ripley from easily escaping from a live facehugger as well (bottom left image).!<

EDIT: u/BreastUsername found [a captioned YouTube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOxmONFwsG4) of the aforementioned scene! It cuts before the milk-drinking, and the door closing is from a later scene.

Also, to clarify—these are just a few of the subtle hints/foreshadowings that I observed. The movie has a few others, plus more overt scenes where Ash's actual actions foreshadow his motives (like opening the airlock against Ripley's orders) that I obviously haven't mentioned here since they're actual plot elements!",Spoiler

I would disagree with this almost entirely. In fact, AC is notorious for the fact that many of her mysteries are effectively unsolvable. If you have read a lot of her books, it is certainly possible to guess the culprit, simply because you kind of get used to the flow of her stories and the ratio of foregrounding/backgrounding she uses for culprits/victims/red herring characters, but it is frequently completely impossible to actually ferret out the actual explanation of what happened or any conclusive justification for it decisively being one character over another. 


It's been a while since i read Death on the Nile, but I *think* the movie added in some of the ""clues"" >!e.g. the missing red paint!< to make it more ""solvable""--and Death on the Nile is probably one of the more predictable endings of any of her books that I've read.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom Megathread [Spoilers],"6.5/10 - It's not a bad movie. It's not a great one either.

Spoiler-ish review:

>!It does seem that this Jurassic World series is attempting to mirror the original Trilogy in it's themes. The first is both surrounds the idea of a park full of dinosaurs, only with Jurassic Park being it being in a beta test and Jurassic World it being open. The second surrounds the idea of the dinosaurs as living things. The team go back to the dinosaurs on a seemingly peaceful mission where some shady stuff is going down from another team who end up bringing dinosaurs from the dinosaurs which inevitably escape. With the film ending with Dinosaurs being released into the world it does make me wonder if as a result Jurassic World III will be a sort of 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' but with Dinosaurs. It'd be essentially a rescue/survival movie which was essentially what Jurassic Park III at the end of the day.!<",Spoiler
Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom Megathread [Spoilers],"I really like the idea of splitting up the two really big stories here.

The part 2 taking place in the developing story at the mansion and, through flashbacks, developing Lockwood and Hammond's relationship and the actual story of recreating dinosaurs and then later finding out that Lockwood also went on to use this information to >!clone humans!< would have really given weight to the final reveal that >!Maisie!< was a result of this research . Absolutely brilliant idea.",Spoiler
The Lighthouse (2019) references the Sacha Schneider painting Hypnosis (1904),"Spoilers ahead:

>!The ending of the lighthouse closely resembles the fate of Prometheus, the Greek titan who is condemned to an eternity of torment by Zeus, for the crime of stealing the fire of Olympus and granting it to humanity. The fire in this myth is an analogy for technology, or more broadly, for man's striving towards knowledge. For his crime of stealing the fire of the Gods, Prometheus is set upon a boulder on a mountainside, and condemned to have his liver eaten by an Eagle (an emblem of Zeus) only to have it regrown the next day to begin the cycle anew. 

Prometheus is mentioned by Wake just before the final scene, and is also closely connected to the lighthouse itself. As Winslow peers into the light of the lighthouse in the second to last scene, he is overwhelmed by what he sees.

The second important character for the end scene is Proteus, an aquatic deity whom Wake represents. In Greek myth, Proteus is a deity that holds knowledge, but refuses to relinquish it. In myth Proteus continually shapeshifts his form in order to protect his knowledge. Importantly, Proteus is portrayed in modern art and literature as an allegory of the unconscious (by Carl Jung), self exploration (by James Joyce in Ulysses), and more broadly, by the seeking of ""higher knowledge"", similar to Prometheus.

I think these two characters of Greek Myth can be interpreted in many different ways. However, one of the key themes in the film is the idea of repressed homosexuality, and the historical precedent of mariners engaging in homosexual activity.

Other allegories and references to these themes include the one eyed gull (an allegory for the penis), Winslow masturbating over the mermaid only for it to turn into Wake, and Winslow and Wake almost sharing a kiss whilst drunk, amongst others. Interestingly, although we do not know the relationship Winslow has with his logging partner, it seems likely that his relationship with the man he killed had a similar homosexual capacity to Winslow's relationship with Wake. This is revealed as the story unfolds and Wake meets a similar end to Winslow's previous logging partner, compounding the analogy.

With these scenes of Greek Myth and homosexuality in mind, I think we have a much better understanding of the end scene of the lighthouse. As Winslow peers into the light (guarded by Wake, an allegory for Proteus) he is permanently scarred by what he sees in it, and this completes Winslows journey into madness which has been building up over the course of the previous scenes and the film overall. What Winslow sees in the lighthouse can be seen as an allegory for his own unconscious and sexual exploration: as Winslow reveals to himself his true sexuality (and the crimes he has committed to cover it up), he is driven mad due to the full repressive extent of the complex he has built up. What I think is particularly beautiful about this last scene, is that the ""light"" which Winslow peers into is pure, and representative of his sexuality - what seems to drive him mad is the course of repression he is forced into taking by the culture and time that he exists in.

I think there are many interpretations with this films, and I do think that Roger Eggers made the film to be interpreted in many ways, though I would say one of the main themes of the Lighthouse is about homosexuality, and many of the main themes highlight this - the Greek Myths, the mariners setting, the masturbation, the lack of any female characters and references. This is my interpretation, and it is by no means extensive, and I'd love to hear if anyone else has some Greek Mythology that is revealed by the film too!!<",Spoiler

The Lighthouse (2019) references the Sacha Schneider painting Hypnosis (1904),"So there seems to be two main inspirations for the story of The Lighthouse. Though there are other interpretations that are just as valid, but from what I've seen online most people agree about these.

It is based off a real life situation where 2 (or 3?) men that were manning an island lighthouse off the coast of Britain disappeared. When relief came to check on the men/relieve them of duty, no one was on the island. No bodies, nothing. Their boat(s) were still there and there was no sign of a disturbance. The only odd thing was that it seemed one of them was in the middle of a meal, like there was a half-eaten meal on the table that hadn't been cleaned up. A journal was found that had daily logs from one of the men, it seemed to get slightly nonsensical towards the end of the entries. Theories about what happened all seem to assume they went crazy and either fell into the sea or tried to swim away for some reason. If I remember correctly there were some brutal storms before they had disappeared. Another movie was made on the subject called The Vanishing (2018).

The other inspiration for the film seems to be the story of Prometheus. There are two shots in particular that are straight from the myth. There is the shot of >!Willem Dafoe standing over Pattinson with a beam of light shooting from his eyes!< and >!then there is the shot of Pattinson getting his guts eaten by seagulls at the end of the movie!<.",Spoiler

"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right? LOST spoilers","I'm still not sure I really understood Jacob's plan. 

OK so Jacob and smoke monster are trapped on island. Check. Someone needs to contain smoke monster and *keep* him trapped on island or he will do bad things to world. Check. 

OK with plot so far. 

Island also has general magical properties which various groups have tried to harness/exploit over time, much to chagrin of Jacob, as this is all probably bad for containing smoke monster. Check. 

But why do they have to press the button to release energy? I mean I know why - so there isn't an explosion - but like how did we even get into that situation to begin with? It seems like pretty Dharma arrival that wasn't an issue?

And who cares anyway, because the explosion happened and didn't seem to have any serious effects. 

Also, why were people in hazmat suits?

And finally my biggest question: why were Jacob and the others always so cryptic and creepy and kidnappy? Like...I get the idea of testing potential guardians, but doesn't it seem like Jacob's setup was like....the worst possible way to do it?

Watching hours of flash sideways only to find out none of it mattered because the stakes were to get them together to hug in the afterlife is so convoluted and pointless the effect isn't really any different. Did anyone honestly watch LOST to see if the characters would reconnect in the afterlife? Of course not, but that's most peoples memory of the finale. The characters in the afterlife having a reunion.

The mysteries were interesting in the early seasons because the show felt otherwise pretty grounded. Finding out that it all comes down to analogous versions of god and the devil fighting over a magic light is so fucking lame.

***

edit: A lot of responses seem to be about how the show always had supernatural/magic elements- and it did. But you all might be forgetting how often the writers/producers of LOST promised that there were a scientific basis for why everything was happening and it would all be explained eventually.

 Damon Lindelof said the show was “firmly ensconced in science fact” and that everything in it had a “rational explanation in the real world we all function in."" They made these explicit promises multiple times during the first 3-4ish seasons of the show. That's why the ending is so reviled.

Does it really say that? Couple thoughts on this. 

First, half of Season 6 was explicitly stated to be essentially purgatory IIRC, as it's explained that the 'sideways' was a place for these characters to bop around before entering the 'great beyond'... ie, *a form of purgatory*... by Jack's father in the church-like place in the finale.  

Second, the whole show is about showing these characters' past sins, finding themselves trapped in a new location away from their old lives where people assume they are dead, and them dealing with said sins in some manner on the island. Absolutely some pretty strong purgatory vibes.

Their explanation is like saying Harry Potter isn’t about sorcery, it’s about magic which is a totally different thing! (It’s really not, it’s just semantics.)

So yes. I listened to the podcast Damon and Carlton did every week. It was the first podcast I ever listened to, in fact. And they told us over and over and over that the show wasn’t headed in that direction, that there was another explanation for what the island was and why they were all there… 

And then it ends up being a weird semantic argument that made them *technically* right, but we all know the spirit of the end was exactly what we were predicting it would be the entire time.

The amount of time and energy my friends and I wasted coming up with theories and explanations about the shit going on on that island - the smoke monster, the hatch, the donkey wheel, NOT PENNY'S BOAT, the f**kin numbers!! - I would not change it for the world.

I played Lost: Via Domus just in case there was some shit in there would explain stuff. 

But, it declined in quality as the seasons progressed, and you could tell that the writers didn't know how to, or didn't want to, try to explain what was going on. The story had not been thought through - it was typical JJ ""Mystery Box"" Abrams stuff - and later seasons were sort of making it up on the fly. 

I never bought into them being dead the whole time or in purgatory - just because we had been shown too many hints to real world explanations of the mysteries - but it was certainly one of the theories that was banded about at the time. 

After the last episode I was just like ""ok then"" and it never felt satisfying.

I've watched it since and it stands up quite well and when binged you can connect the threads a bit easier.

Lots of work was done to try to clear up ""fun"" choices that were made in the moment of writing. There wasn't a clear plot that the show had from the beginning. There was no plan or clear ending they were driving towards.

The ending op outlines and some said was ""spoon fed"" and ""couldn't have been made simpler"" is ridiculous. The ending of this show that has been interpreted by millions was not cut and dry. It was not simple. Evidenced by the fact that it's not clear to millions of people that watched it.

The show is not well written. It had a really fun beginning where the writers threw tons of ideas into the show without a plan to tie it together. When old ideas became too thin, they introduced another unsupported idea.  When it finally got into the last seasons the writers started making up reasons how everything tied up with dues ex machina over and over again. The final dues ex machina was so large, in order to fit all the original unsupported ideas, that it broke reality.

Why is Jacob so cryptic and why does he have so many tests for the guardian?  Jacob is not an omnipotent being, he is just a regular human who became the island ""guardian"".  He wasn't even the first choice of the previous guardian his ""brother"" was.  Also Jacob created the smoke monster by killing his brother and shoving him into the hole, the first of his many errors as guardian.  

Basically, Jacob is a guy that became guardian by chance and is kind of winging it.  He also doesn't do that great of a job.  A lot of the problems on the island are because of Jacob's failures.

You have the Season 1-2 Lost, which was a science fiction show with a psychic kid and a cliffhanger ending by JJ Abrams. Season 2 was plotted out by the original staff but written by new folks. [Javier Grillo Marxuach](http://okbjgm.weebly.com/uploads/3/1/5/0/31506003/2._lost.pdf) quit, the last original writer at the end of Season 2. 

Then there’s a spinoff show from the original, also called Lost. But it is NOT a sci fi show about nanobots or psychic kids (who hit growth spurts in real life.) It’s a character drama with psuedoreligious lore.   

But no one told people who watched the first two seasons that this was now a spinoff. So they kept watching, assuming everything would round back into sci fi form. When it didn’t, and the spinoff show ended on its own terms but left the first two seasons’ threads either abandoned or answered by basically saying “god(s) did it,” people got mad.

"""they were dead the whole time"" has to be the biggest misconception in television ever, right? LOST spoilers","I liked Lost overall, but there was a palpable tension in the end as the writers were struggling to give emotionally impactful endings to their characters while also providing the answers to the mysteries that the audience was clamoring for.

I think they were overall correct that the character beats were more important than the actual answers, but where things felt uneven and where I think they missed the boat is that they split those into separate categories.

What the audience kept asking for was “answers” but what they actually wanted was “payoff” which are answers that are impactful and important to the characters and story.

I don’t think that the problem with the answers that we got was how grounded (or not) they were. It’s that they didn’t really tie in to the characters and their stories in any meaningful way. 

It could have been as ungrounded as they wanted if it felt like it fell perfectly in line with all of the character work and narrative build up that had happened up to that point.

But it kinda just didn’t. 

To be fair to Lost, it sits at an awkward point in time just as television was transitioning from the open-ended “just sit with the characters once a week” style of storytelling that had dominated most television up to that point to the tighter more over-arching narrative focus that has become the norm for most prestige shows now.

Lost *feels* like the latter in terms of style and premise but is structured more like the former on an overall basis, and it’s *really* hard to take the former structure and give it satisfying conclusion.

It doesn't really, it's a very deliberate choice to integrate the epilogue into each episode. Otherwise you would have like 5 bonus episodes at the end overloaded with conclusions.

For example, the ""Dr. Linus"" episode (S6E7) completes Ben's arc two-fold. On the island, he's forgiven for his actions by Ilana. That sets him up to complete his arc in his flash-sideways/afterlife, in which he chooses his daughter over power (as opposed to Ben's decision in his arc's turning point, S4E9 when he chooses power over his daughter.)

What's even more amazing is that Ben's musical theme, which leaves you on a cliffhanger musically throughout the series by cutting off before the movement is completed, is FINISHED in that forgiveness scene with Ilana. Fucking gorgeous. This was a Michael Giacchino score.

This seems to be why there's so much confusion about the ending. So much of the last season makes it seem like nothing that happened matters, but the show emphasizes that it matters differently... kinda like a religion to its adherents or a fictional story to its fans.

But then realizing that it was taking place in some sort of _afterlife_ was soooo damn beautiful. The flash sideways shows each character being given another chance to overcome trauma and hardships, tests that they faced and mostly failed in this reality. What the 'sideways' sections show is that their ends were not tragic because they were not final. John Locke killing himself after being manipulated was not his end. He was given another chance, another opportunity to face these same tests before transitioning to an afterlife. For some the overtly spiritual concepts (which draws bits and pieces from basically every religious tradition) are a turnoff, which I get.

So those characters all died before him. When Jack dies, Kate, Hurley, Sawyer, etc are still alive. So they had to have died long after him. 

This has to mean that everything we saw was real and sequential and all the events (namely the deaths) happened when we saw them. If they all died in the crash, and the entire series was purgatory, they wouldn’t have died at different times. They would have died at the same time.

Yes they traveled in time. That's what the whispers in the forest from ""the others"" were, along with other events. It asks the question of determinism. They went back in time to do a thing that produced an effect that would later loop on itself, regardless of what they did. 

The smoke was the ""bad god"", and he can impersonate the dead, as well as show a character their deepest failings / ""judge"" them.

But about 2/3 through the season there’s a big reveal and things fall back into place again. And seasons 3 and 4 are just amazing. The show picks back up and doesn’t quit until the end. 

And here’s what it has that Lost lacked- they knew the end before they started. Creator and show runner Sam Esmail envisioned it as a screenplay first, but when he started writing he had too much material. But he knew the major plot points for the whole series before they started working on the pilot. He knew it would be 4 or 5 seasons. (We got 4.) He knew where Elliot was going from the very beginning. 

There are references to the finale in the pilot, and there are scenes from the end in S1. And it all fits together so perfectly, going back to rewatch is an absolute trip. The second time through the show, it feels like the show actually changes. It’s so wild. 

I tell everyone that you haven’t seen the whole show until you’ve seen it twice, and I stand by that. And coming back to S2- it’s setting up new characters and storylines. It’s foggy and complicated when you don’t understand how it all fits together. But once you know the whole thing, I’d bet some of your favorite episodes will be from S2. You just have to see the whole picture. 

Here’s the thing. I’ve seen a lot of great tv. Lost was one of those shows. It changed what we thought tv could be. Breaking Bad was another. 

But Mr. Robot hits their heights, but it also *changed me as a person.* It did more for me than 20 years in the church and 10 years in therapy did for me.

That being said, I disliked The Last Jedi in particular for *so many more* reasons than that: Marvel humor, the entirety of the Canto Blight sequence, Rose ramming Finn and preventing him from (suicidally) saving a bunch of people, Benicio Del Toro’s dreadful character, Phasma dying comically easily, Maz Kanata’s goofy scenes, Admiral Holdo being presented as a hero for withholding information from her crew for no reason, and Leia’s ridiculous flying-in-space scene.

"Black Mirror: San Junipero, is a masterpiece that every person should watch *no spoilers*","Quagmire is defined as a ""an awkward, complex, or hazardous situation"".  The people who chose to stay in San Junipero did so because they weren't ready to pass on, or they just didn't want to.  They had some aspect of their lives that they felt was unfulfilled, yet they failed to find that in their time in San Junipero.  So the Quagmire itself is that they aren't happy being alive but they aren't content to pass on or die or unplug or whatever it is.  They're stuck there out of whatever emotions fuel people who fail to find happiness in life yet fail to find the courage to give up.  At its core, it is one of the biggest predicaments we face in our lives, but held in suspense, purgatory if you would, for the possibility of forever.

Yorkie wasn't ready to pass on, she hadn't ever experienced the opportunity to really live.  Kelly, on the other hand, had a full life with a husband that she spent decades with, a child who passed on before her, and all of life that Yorkie knew nothing about.  Kelly was content with passing on, but Yorkie was not and wanted her to stay.  Will they both be happy?  Will either one of them be happy?  Should one person sacrifice their happiness for another's?

I think the most sensible approach is this:

Since, the dead instance doesnt exist, no instance actually experienced death.
The only existing one, is the one that survived, by definition.

What TV Shows are nearly unrecognizable from their pilot? [Spoilers],"Twin Peaks, kind of maybe. I think this story is funny.

Twin peaks is a murder mystery, where Laura Palmer is killed by a guy known only as ""Bob.""

There was an alternate version of the first episode for regions where the show didn't get renewed, where the characters discover Bob is a guy that lives in the basement of the hospital, and they go there and shoot him.

I've heard that, in Australia, they got the alternate version of the pilot... and then still got the rest of the show. So you have 2 seasons of characters wondering when they're gonna find that guy they shot to death in the first episode.

EDIT: seems like Europe got the home video release of the alternate pilot. So maybe it was somewhere there.
